      "\n",
      "A credit card's welcome bonus is often the most valuable benefit. However, it's only a one-time perk, so you'll want to carefully consider everything else the card offers before applying. As you're analyzing intro bonus offers, it's important to pay attention to two factors: Bonus value and requirements. Bonus value For certain types of cards, it's simple to estimate the bonus value. For example, a cash bonus of $500 is worth $500, but how much are 50,000 points or miles worth? The answer depends on the type of rewards and how you intend to use them: Hotel points or airline miles: Only redeemable within the specific program, limiting your options\n",
      "\n",
      "Only redeemable within the specific program, limiting your options Transferrable points: These can typically be moved to many different airlines or hotels, which could provide you with more choices. This added flexibility can increase the value of flexible rewards, so 50,000 transferrable points are generally worth more than 50,000 hotel points. Bonus requirements If you're approved for a card, you'll still need to meet the spending requirement before you're awarded any bonus points, miles or cash. To ensure you can hit the spending threshold without overspending, look at your credit card statement for the past few months or the year. This should give you a good idea of how much you can expect to spend on your new card. If you usually spend $1,500 on your credit card(s) each month, then any card with a spending requirement of $4,500 or less within three months should be achievable. You can also plan your credit card application around bigger, but less frequent expenses. If you're paying your annual insurance premiums or booking lodging for your yearly vacation, it might make sense to apply for a card beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit card welcome bonus pros and cons\n",
      "\n",
      "Card credit intro bonuses can help you collect loads of miles, points or other rewards. However, these are one-time bonuses, and you need to look at a card's benefits and perks to get the full picture of whether it's a worthy addition to your wallet. Welcome bonuses also typically have spending requirements that need to be met within a certain timeframe and these requirements aren't always easy to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros Welcome bonuses can be exceptionally valuable, even when factoring in the spending requirement. The best offers may provide 10X to 20X points per dollar on the spending you need to make to earn the bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intro bonuses allow you to quickly earn enough rewards to book more valuable redemptions, such as business-class flights or luxury hotels that typically have higher point or mile requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons A card's welcome bonus could entice you to spend more than you otherwise would have. In this scenario, you may end up paying interest if you can't afford to pay off the balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intro bonuses are one-off card benefits, so you need to make sure the card's ongoing perks are worth it or offset the annual fee (if there is one).\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What is a credit card sign-up bonus? A credit card sign-up bonus is an incentive to entice consumers to open a new credit card and make purchases with the card. You typically need to spend a certain amount within a specified period to earn the bonus. How do credit card sign-up bonuses work? Credit card sign-up bonuses are typically one-time offers you can qualify for when you open a new card. These rewards often come in the form of cashback, points or miles, and generally require spending a certain amount of money with that card within the first few months of account opening. The spending thresholds vary but generally range from $500 to $5,000. Are credit card sign-up bonus offers worth it? Credit card sign-up bonuses can be worth it as they can add hundreds of dollars (or sometimes even over a thousand dollars) back to your wallet and are generally non-taxable since you had to spend money to earn them. However, you should only pursue a welcome bonus if you can meet the spending requirement without overspending or stretching yourself too thin. You don't want to carry a balance just to earn a bonus since the interest charges could outweigh the value of any rewards you earn. How many credit card sign-up bonuses can you earn? Some card issuers like American Express limit the number of sign-up bonuses you can earn for a card to once per lifetime, while others may allow you to earn a sign-up bonus multiple times, but may make you wait a certain period of time before being eligible again. What sign-up bonuses are the easiest to get? Cashback cards generally have sign-up bonuses that are easier to earn. What is the best credit card sign-up bonus? While the best credit card sign-up bonus will depend on the individual, travel rewards cards like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and The Platinum Card® from American Express currently offer some of the largest welcome bonuses. Are credit card sign-up bonuses taxed? Credit card sign-up bonuses are typically not considered taxable income because they usually have a spending requirement, which makes them a form of rebate or discount.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine which cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S. and offer welcome bonuses. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back.

      "\n",
      "A credit card's welcome bonus is often the most valuable benefit. However, it's only a one-time perk, so you'll want to carefully consider everything else the card offers before applying. As you're analyzing intro bonus offers, it's important to pay attention to two factors: Bonus value and requirements. Bonus value For certain types of cards, it's simple to estimate the bonus value. For example, a cash bonus of $500 is worth $500, but how much are 50,000 points or miles worth? The answer depends on the type of rewards and how you intend to use them: Hotel points or airline miles: Only redeemable within the specific program, limiting your options\n",
      "\n",
      "Only redeemable within the specific program, limiting your options Transferrable points: These can typically be moved to many different airlines or hotels, which could provide you with more choices. This added flexibility can increase the value of flexible rewards, so 50,000 transferrable points are generally worth more than 50,000 hotel points. Bonus requirements If you're approved for a card, you'll still need to meet the spending requirement before you're awarded any bonus points, miles or cash. To ensure you can hit the spending threshold without overspending, look at your credit card statement for the past few months or the year. This should give you a good idea of how much you can expect to spend on your new card. If you usually spend $1,500 on your credit card(s) each month, then any card with a spending requirement of $4,500 or less within three months should be achievable. You can also plan your credit card application around bigger, but less frequent expenses. If you're paying your annual insurance premiums or booking lodging for your yearly vacation, it might make sense to apply for a card beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit card welcome bonus pros and cons\n",
      "\n",
      "Card credit intro bonuses can help you collect loads of miles, points or other rewards. However, these are one-time bonuses, and you need to look at a card's benefits and perks to get the full picture of whether it's a worthy addition to your wallet. Welcome bonuses also typically have spending requirements that need to be met within a certain timeframe and these requirements aren't always easy to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros Welcome bonuses can be exceptionally valuable, even when factoring in the spending requirement. The best offers may provide 10X to 20X points per dollar on the spending you need to make to earn the bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intro bonuses allow you to quickly earn enough rewards to book more valuable redemptions, such as business-class flights or luxury hotels that typically have higher point or mile requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons A card's welcome bonus could entice you to spend more than you otherwise would have. In this scenario, you may end up paying interest if you can't afford to pay off the balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intro bonuses are one-off card benefits, so you need to make sure the card's ongoing perks are worth it or offset the annual fee (if there is one).\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What is a credit card sign-up bonus? A credit card sign-up bonus is an incentive to entice consumers to open a new credit card and make purchases with the card. You typically need to spend a certain amount within a specified period to earn the bonus. How do credit card sign-up bonuses work? Credit card sign-up bonuses are typically one-time offers you can qualify for when you open a new card. These rewards often come in the form of cashback, points or miles, and generally require spending a certain amount of money with that card within the first few months of account opening. The spending thresholds vary but generally range from $500 to $5,000. Are credit card sign-up bonus offers worth it? Credit card sign-up bonuses can be worth it as they can add hundreds of dollars (or sometimes even over a thousand dollars) back to your wallet and are generally non-taxable since you had to spend money to earn them. However, you should only pursue a welcome bonus if you can meet the spending requirement without overspending or stretching yourself too thin. You don't want to carry a balance just to earn a bonus since the interest charges could outweigh the value of any rewards you earn. How many credit card sign-up bonuses can you earn? Some card issuers like American Express limit the number of sign-up bonuses you can earn for a card to once per lifetime, while others may allow you to earn a sign-up bonus multiple times, but may make you wait a certain period of time before being eligible again. What sign-up bonuses are the easiest to get? Cashback cards generally have sign-up bonuses that are easier to earn. What is the best credit card sign-up bonus? While the best credit card sign-up bonus will depend on the individual, travel rewards cards like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and The Platinum Card® from American Express currently offer some of the largest welcome bonuses. Are credit card sign-up bonuses taxed? Credit card sign-up bonuses are typically not considered taxable income because they usually have a spending requirement, which makes them a form of rebate or discount.\n",

      "Our methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine which cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S. and offer welcome bonuses. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back.

      "\n",
      "Deciding which credit-building card is best for you depends heavily on your situation and how you plan to use the card. Know what cards you're eligible for Your credit score goes a long way in determining what cards you can qualify for. If you're looking to boost your credit score from average to excellent to increase your approval odds for a home loan, an unsecured credit card could work for you. Credit cards for average credit may also have rewards and other benefits for you to take advantage of. If you're new to credit or recovering from bankruptcy, you may need to start with a secured credit card. Some credit cards offer pre-approval or pre-qualification, which doesn't guarantee you'll be approved for a card, but it can save you from applying for a card you're likely to be rejected for. In some situations, it may make sense to apply for a card issued by the bank where you have checking or savings accounts because that could boost your approval odds. Understand what matters when building credit By making on-time payments, credit cards allow you to slowly rebuild your credit score or fill out your credit report. When you keep your credit card balance low, or ideally, pay it off fully each month, this also helps boost your credit score. So building good financial habits is more important than finding the most rewarding credit card. When you want to use a credit card to establish your credit history, think of rewards as icing on the cake. Don't look for lucrative welcome bonuses or overspending to earn rewards on unlock benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to build credit with a credit card\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different types of credit scoring models, such as FICO Score and VantageScore, but the most popular scores use the information on your credit report. They typically use the information from the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. By opening a credit card, you're adding to your credit profile. However, how you use the credit card is what matters the most. Pay your monthly bill on time Your payment history is a huge part of your credit score. So it's important to pay your credit card bill on time and consistently. As these payments are documented in your credit report, your credit score is more likely to improve over time. Keep your balance low Your total debt also factors heavily into how your credit score is calculated. Having less debt and using a smaller percentage of your available credit (keeping a low credit utilization ratio) will have a positive impact on your credit score. This makes having a budget in place an important part of building credit. It can be easy to overspend with a credit card and if you find yourself in this situation, it could hurt your credit instead of help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of cards to look for if you want to build credit\n",
      "\n",
      "Rewards and travel benefits shouldn't be the priority when building credit. Rather, you should use a credit-building card to establish responsible credit habits. Once you're in a situation where you can consistently pay off your credit cards in full and on time, then you're ready to consider credit cards with larger welcome bonuses and useful benefits. Secured credit cards Secured credit cards require an upfront deposit and your credit limit is based on that deposit. Secured credit cards like the Discover it® Secured Credit Card are less risky for card issuers and you can possibly qualify for secured cards with no credit history or if you have a weak credit score. Unsecured credit cards do not require a security deposit and have a credit limit based on your income, credit history and other factors. There are unsecured credit cards available to those with average or fair credit, but in general, if you have no credit or bad credit, an unsecured credit card will be your best option for moving your credit score forward. Student credit cards If you're interested in opening your first credit card, are over 18 years old and are enrolled in an eligible college, consider a student credit card like the Discover it® Student Cash Back. These cards are designed with students in mind and are often available even if you don't have a credit history. Many of these cards also don't require a security deposit and some even offer rewards.\n",

      "What does it mean to build your credit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your credit score is based on the information in your credit report. To build your credit you need activity, like credit card and loan payments, to be reported to credit bureaus. Your credit score is generally based on factors such as payment history, the age of your accounts and total debt. When you open a credit card and pay the balance on time consistently, this improves your credit score and is a signal to creditors that you're a reliable borrower. However, having a credit card can work both ways. If you miss payments or are late paying, that harms your credit score. Also, if you pay on time, but accumulate debt that can hurt your credit score. Overall, the best way to build credit is to have a long history of positive activity (i.e. paying on time) with creditors such as banks and credit unions.\n",

      "Tips for building credit\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no set formula for building credit. Instead, your habits, over time, will move your credit score in one direction or another. However, there are a few tips that can help you get things headed in the right direction. Understand how credit scores work Knowing what goes into your credit score is key to building a healthy credit profile. While there are multiple types of credit scores, the most popular credit scoring models are largely based on factors such as: Payment history\n",

      "Age of accounts Each factor is weighted differently, and your payment history and debt typically are more important. It's important to develop the habit of paying bills on time and creating a plan to stay out of debt or pay down your existing debt if you want to improve your credit score. Get added as an authorized user If your lack of credit history is preventing you from getting approved for a credit card or a car loan, it might make sense to get added as an authorized user on someone else's account. When you're added as an authorized user, the credit history of that account could be added to your credit report. This can be a double-edged sword, so it only makes sense to go this route with someone with a history of paying their credit cards on time and in full. Monitor your credit A credit monitoring service can help you maintain an error-free credit report by alerting you when anything changes on your credit report.

      "FAQs Why is building credit important? Building a good credit score is necessary for many major financial moves, including taking out a mortgage, opening a credit card, getting car insurance and sometimes even landing your dream job. If you don't have a good or excellent credit score, you may not get approved for a certain financial product or may pay higher interest rates. What are the benefits of building credit? Building credit has many benefits because nearly every facet of your financial life is impacted by the strength of your credit score. Building a good credit score helps improve your approval odds for financial products, helps you qualify for lower interest rates and better terms and allows you to to benefit from robust credit card benefits. Can I get approved for a credit card with no credit history? It is possible to sign up for a credit card without having a credit history. It's generally easier to get approved for secured credit cards or starter credit cards, which are designed especially for those who are beginning to build their credit. How do I improve my credit score? The best way to improve your credit score is by consistently practicing responsible credit behavior, such as paying your bills on time every month and limiting your credit utilization ratio. Do authorized users build credit? Becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit card is a great way to build credit. So long as the primary cardholder has good (670 to 799) or excellent credit (800 to 850), it can be relatively low-risk and allows you to build or boost your credit score. However, there are also instances where being an authorized user can harm your credit score, such as if the primary account holder misses a payment.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine which cards offer the best value for rebuilding credit CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back. When choosing the best credit cards for rebuilding credit, we focused on cards that are available to consumers with lower credit scores or those with no credit history. While rewards and other benefits were also factored into our decisions, these were secondary considerations.

      "What are the benefits of refinancing debt?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you carry a balance on a credit card (or multiple cards) with a high APR, you might want to consider debt refinancing. Simply put, you take out a new loan to pay off old debt, then pay back the new debt according to agreed-upon terms. It makes sense to refinance if you can't afford your current bill payments and need to find a lower monthly plan, or if your credit score is good enough to qualify you for a lower APR, which makes paying off the debt cheaper. For example, say you have a $10,000 balance on your credit card that charges interest at a rate of 24.99% APR. Assuming you can afford to make $400 monthly payments, it would take about three years to pay your balance off entirely. You'll also pay about $4,000 in interest, according to Experian's debt payoff calculator. On the other hand, transferring that debt to a personal loan with a 9% APR, can save you more than $3,000. Experian's calculator estimates with the same monthly payment ($400) and the lower APR, you can pay off the balance in 22 months and only pay $875 in interest charges overall. When you apply for a personal loan, you should consider the APR and the loan's term, or the length of time it will take you to pay it off. Make sure the monthly loan repayment amount fits into your budget, so you're able to comfortably pay off the loan and get your debt under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can debt refinancing hurt your credit score?\n",
      "\n",
      "At its best, debt refinancing can boost your credit score by making your monthly payments more affordable and motivating you to pay off your balances. But they aren't entirely risk-free. Personal loan applications require a credit check, so you'll want to make sure you know your credit score before you apply. There's no direct penalty for getting denied a loan, but having too many applications on your credit record could be a red flag to future lenders. For debt refinancing to work, you have to \"plan your work and work your plan,\" so to speak. It helps to be honest about your money habits and the overall state of your personal finances before taking on any loan. Personal loans deliver cash directly to your bank account, making it easy to stay in debt if you're not careful. If you have concerns, opt for a loan that pays your creditors directly so that there's no opportunity for you to overspend. And before you agree to a new loan, make sure you have room in your budget to pay it back on time and in full according to the terms. A late payment on your personal loan can hurt your credit score just like if you miss a credit card bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a good interest rate on a personal loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most personal loans come with fixed-rate APRs, so your monthly payment stays the same for the loan's lifetime. In a few cases, you can take out a variable-rate personal loan. If you go that route, make sure you're comfortable with your monthly payments changing if rates go up or down. Personal loan APRs average 9.65%, according to the Fed's most recent data. Meanwhile, the average credit card interest rate is around 16.28%. When considering whether to invest or pay off debt, consider that the average rate of return in the stock market tends to be above 5% when adjusted for inflation. So if you can find a personal loan with interest rates would be below 5%, you can slowly pay off your debt while also investing because you know your investments could still earn more than you're paying in interest. However, it's not always easy to qualify for personal loans with interest rates lower than 5% APR. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do personal loans work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you're approved for a personal loan, the cash is usually delivered directly to your checking account. However, if you opt for a debt consolidation/refinancing loan, you can sometimes have your lender pay your credit card accounts directly. Any extra cash leftover will be deposited into your bank account or returned to the lender. Most loan terms range anywhere from six months to seven years. The longer the term, the lower your monthly payments will be, but they usually also have higher interest rates. It's best to elect for the shortest term you can afford. When deciding on a loan term, consider how much you will end up paying in interest overall. Your monthly loan bill will include your installment payment plus interest charges. If you think you may want to pay off the loan earlier than planned, be sure to check if the lender charges an early payoff or prepayment penalty. Sometimes lenders charge a fee if you make extra payments to pay your debt down quicker, since they are losing out on that prospective interest. The fee could be a flat rate, a percentage of your loan amount or the rest of the interest you would have owed them. Once you receive the money from your loan, you have to pay back the lender in monthly installments, usually starting within 30 days. When your personal loan is paid off, the credit line is closed and you no longer have access to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is my personal loan rate decided?\n",
      "\n",
      "As you shop for a low-interest loan or credit card, remember that banks are looking for reliable borrowers who make timely payments. Financial institutions will look at your credit score, income, payment history and, in some cases, cash reserves when deciding what APR to give you. To get approved for any kind of credit product (credit card, loan, mortgage, etc.), you'll first submit an application and agree to let the lender pull your credit report. This helps lenders understand how much debt you owe, what your current monthly payments are and how much additional debt you have the capacity to take on. Once you submit your application, you may be approved for a variety of loan options. Each will have a different length of time to pay the loan back (your term) and a different interest rate. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. Generally, loans with longer terms have higher interest rates than loans you bay back over a shorter period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine which personal loans are the best for refinancing debt, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

      "We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more. *Your LightStream loan terms, including APR, may differ based on loan purpose, amount, term length, and your credit profile. Excellent credit is required to qualify for lowest rates. Rate is quoted with AutoPay discount. AutoPay discount is only available prior to loan funding.

Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees.

The co-borrower on a personal loan application shares the liability for repaying the loan with the primary borrower which is why lenders may see a borrower as less risky if they have another person applying alongside them. Origination fees are between 2.41% to 5% and get deducted from the loan proceeds.

      "What is considered a quick loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Loans that can be disbursed as soon as the same business day as approval (or even one business day later) are typically considered quick loans. Most lenders can provide funding in a few days, usually 3–5 business days after approval. However, some lenders who disburse funds through a mailed check can take longer to get you the loan proceeds — usually closer to a week. That's why a quick loan is the ideal solution for someone who wants (or needs) their money ASAP.\n",

This is good news since you won't be at risk of losing something valuable, like your car, if you default on the loan. However, there will still be implications to your credit score if you fail to repay your loan, as with any other form of credit.\n",

Though, it is possible to find lenders that don't charge these fees. Higher monthly payments: For the most part, credit cards require a low minimum monthly payment (though, experts advise paying off your balance in full each month). With personal loans, though, your monthly payment is often higher than that of credit cards even if you have a long loan term. Granted, you're able to borrow higher amounts with a personal loan than you would with a credit card.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you apply for a quick loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you should compare different quick loans. Many lenders will let you check (for free) on their websites what interest rate you'll likely receive with them. This lets you eliminate the high-rate options and hone in on your preferred lender. Once you've picked your lender, you then apply for a loan. This will trigger a hard inquiry on your credit history, which lowers your score a little, so don't apply for more than one loan if you can help it. The application usually requires you to submit personal information like your address, social security number and the loan purpose. The best way to receive a loan quickly is to ensure all information is accurate and complete. Errors or failure to submit complete information could delay the approval process.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the credit requirements for a quick loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit requirements depend on the lender. Most lenders want to see good-to-excellent credit, but a handful of lenders cater to borrowers with fair or poor credit. Be sure to double-check with the lender before applying.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What is a personal loan? A personal loan is a type of installment credit that allows borrowers to receive a one-time lump sum of cash. Borrowers must then pay back that amount plus interest in regular, monthly installments over the loan's term. How do you apply for a personal loan? When applying for a personal loan, you'll need to provide some basic pieces of information, which can include your address, social security number and date of birth, among others. You may also be required to submit pay stubs as proof of income. Some lenders may also require your bank account information. An application can typically be submitted online or in person if the lender has physical branches that you can visit. How do you get a personal loan with bad credit? Some lenders offer personal loans that cater to borrowers with lower credit scores, and may allow borrowers with bad credit to apply with co-borrowers. It's always advised to try to improve your credit score before applying for any form of credit since it can be difficult to qualify with lower credit scores. Additionally, lower credit scores tend to be subject to higher interest rates. What is an unsecured personal loan? An unsecured loan is a form of credit that doesn't require you to put up collateral that can be used to settle your balance if you default on the loan. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.\n",

      "To determine which personal loans are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with no origination or signup fees, fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $500 to $100,000.

After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall financing needs, quick funding, lower interest rates and flexible terms. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate per the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

Account holders can earn up to 15% cash back on select eligible purchases at stores, restaurants and more with BankAmeriDeals® when using a Bank of America debit or credit card. The Bank of America Advantage Savings account requires a $100 opening deposit. There is an $8-per-month maintenance fee that is waived for the first 6 months for new account holders. Customers can avoid paying the monthly fee after the intro period by maintaining a minimum daily balance of at least $500, linking their savings account to their Bank of America Advantage Relationship Banking® checking account or becoming a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member. Students under 24 who are enrolled in school may also qualify for a waiver. There are three tiers to the Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program, and your 3-month average daily balance across your Bank of America deposit and Merrill Lynch/Merrill Edge investment accounts determines which tier you qualify for. You must also have an eligible Bank of America personal checking account to qualify. The tiers include Gold, Platinum and Platinum Honors, and there's a $20,000 minimum balance required. If you qualify and enroll in the Preferred Rewards program, you're also eligible for an elevated APY, ranging from 0.02% to 0.04% depending on which tier. Otherwise, the standard APY is 0.01%.

For those looking to open an account at a bank with the most opportunity for in-person access, Wells Fargo is your best choice. Wells Fargo offers two different savings accounts: the basic Way2Save® Savings and the elevated Platinum Savings. CNBC Select chose Way2Save as the better savings account option because it has a lower minimum daily balance requirement to avoid the monthly service fee ($5 per month for Way2Save and $12 per month for Platinum). To avoid these fees, account holders must either maintain a $300 minimum daily balance or set up their choice of automatic transfers from their checking to their savings: $25 in total, $1 each business day per month or at least one Save As You Go® transfer. With Save As You Go, it's easy to set aside cash. Wells Fargo automatically transfers $1 of a customer's funds from their linked Wells Fargo checking account to their Way2Save account for each qualifying transaction that is a non-recurring debit card purchase or online bill payment using Wells Fargo Online® Bill Pay. To accelerate completing your savings goals, you can set up additional automatic transfers from your checking account each month. There is a $25 minimum opening deposit for this savings account, and those who link a Wells Fargo checking account can opt for overdraft protection. The APY on this account is currently 0.15%.\n",

      "Who's this for? If you are looking for a broad network of ATMs to avoid any out-of-network fees and want a chance to earn a slightly higher APY, consider the savings accounts offered by Chase. Chase Bank has nearly 4,900 branches and 16,000 ATMs. Like Wells Fargo, Chase offers two brick-and-mortar savings accounts: the standard Chase Savings℠ and the Chase Premier Savings℠. The latter is stronger because you can earn better interest rates (what Chase calls \"relationship rates\") on higher balances by linking your savings to a Chase Premier Plus Checking℠ or Chase Sapphire℠ Banking and making at least five transactions in a month using your linked checking account. If you don't link your Chase Premier Savings account to a Chase checking account, the APY is 0.01%. But the APY creeps up slightly if you do have a linked account. For example, you can earn 0.02% APY if you also have a Premier Plus Checking or Chase Sapphire Banking account. By linking to a checking account, you also avoid the monthly $25 service fee that comes with the Chase Premier Savings. Otherwise, there's a daily minimum balance of $15,000 required. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. If you choose to link a Chase Sapphire Banking account, you can take advantage of Sapphire℠ Banking perks, which include special access to sports and entertainment events and early ticket sales. Chase also has an automatic savings program where customers can get help reaching their set savings goals in the bank's mobile app. There is a $5 savings withdrawal limit fee when you make over six withdrawals in a month, including those made at a branch or at an ATM. This fee is waived with a balance of $15,000 or more in the account at the time of withdrawal.\n",

Citi stands out for offering a higher APY than its brick-and-mortar competitors with a 3.85% APY. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account.

      "Who's this for? PNC Bank is a large brick-and-mortar bank with approximately 2,300 branch locations and nearly 18,000 PNC and PNC Partner ATMs. It stands out on our list for its savings account option called Virtual Wallet®, which uses innovative online tools to make it easy to see how you're managing your money day to day. The account is best for those who want to do all their banking in one place as it rewards you for combining your savings and checking into one. New account holders can earn a welcome bonus of up to $400 depending on what type of Virtual Wallet they open. The three choices include Virtual Wallet, Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend and Virtual Wallet with Performance Select. The simple Virtual Wallet has basic account features while the two other options offer more premium rewards. For those enrolled in school, there is also a Virtual Wallet Student option. All of the above Virtual Wallet options include individual accounts that work together: Spend, Reserve and Growth. Spend is your everyday checking account, Reserve your interest-bearing checking account / primary overdraft protection account and Growth is your long-term savings account / secondary overdraft protection account. Higher \"relationship\" interest rates are available on your Growth savings account. The monthly service charges range from $7 to $25, depending on the type of Virtual Wallet you have and can be waived depending on minimum balances in your Spend + Reserve checking accounts (required balances and minimum deposits vary according to the type of Virtual Wallet you have). Virtual Wallet account holders can make free transactions at approximately 9,000 PNC-owned ATMs, and if you end up using a non-PNC ATM, some fees are reimbursed. Through the PNC Purchase Payback® program, customers can also earn cash back or points on purchases made using their PNC Bank Visa® Debit Card which is automatically issued when they sign up for Virtual Wallet. The customized rewards program has offers available from participating merchants depending on your shopping habits. If you're looking for a more straightforward account, PNC Bank also offers a Standard Savings Account. For current APY information, call 1-888-PNC-BANK (1-888-762-2265).\n",

      "Our methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine which brick-and-mortar savings accounts offer the most convenience, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by the largest national banks and credit unions. We narrowed down our ranking by only considering those savings accounts that come from brick-and-mortar banks with broad availability, offering access to at least 700 physical branches and over 4,000 non-fee ATMs in the U.S. While the accounts we chose in this article are from the largest banks, we compared each savings account on a range of features, including its fees, opportunities to earn higher interest rates, customer service and any other special offerings or programs. We also considered factors such as insurance policies, users' deposit options, other savings accounts being offered by the same bank and customer reviews when available. All of the accounts included on this list are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Note that the interest rates and fee structures for brick-and-mortar savings accounts are subject to change without notice. Product and feature availability vary by market so they may not be offered depending on where you live. Most brick-and-mortar banks require you to enter your zip code online for the correct account offerings. Any return on your savings depends on the associated fees and the balance you have in your brick-and-mortar savings account. To open a savings account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank.

      "FAQs What is considered a low down payment? For a conventional mortgage, lenders typically approve qualified borrowers with a down payment of 5% or more. Anything less than that is considered a low down payment. What are some common types of low-down-payment mortgages? FHA loans, VA loans and USDA loans are all popular types of low-down-payment mortgages insured by government agencies, each with its own eligibility requirements. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back HomeReady, Home Possible and HomeOne mortgages. Many banks have proprietary mortgages with low down payments: With Rocket Mortgage's Rocket ONE+ loan, for example, you can put as little as 1% down without private mortgage insurance. Do I have to put down 20% to buy a home? The median down payment for first-time homebuyers between July 2022 and June 2023 was 8%, according to the National Association of Realtors. Putting less than 20% down, however, will likely mean you'll have to pay private mortgage insurance.\n",

When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

Minimum down payment: Although minimum down payment amounts depend on the type of loan a borrower applies for, we noted lenders that offer additional specialty loans that come with a lower minimum down payment amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for no down payment, affordability, no lender fees, low-income borrowers, VA loans, USDA loans and online lenders. Rates and fee structures advertised for mortgages fluctuate in accordance with the Federal Reserve rate. However, once you accept your mortgage agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan, unless you choose to refinance your mortgage at a later date for a potentially lower APR. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history, creditworthiness, debt-to-income ratio and the desired loan term. To take out a mortgage, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "What is a VA loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Guaranteed by the Department of Veteran Affairs, VA loans are zero-down mortgages available to active service members, veterans and some surviving spouses. Because they're backed by the government, they usually have lower interest rates than conventional mortgages and do not require private mortgage insurance. The VA doesn't set credit or income requirements, so lenders tend to have more flexible requirements, too. Instead of mortgage insurance, there is a one-time funding fee that is dependent on how much of a down payment you make:\n",

      "\n",
      "USDA loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and, like VA loans, do not require a down payment or private mortgage insurance. Interest rates on USDA loans are also typically lower than those for conventional loans and credit requirements are also more lenient. Unlike VA loans, however, only borrowers who earn no more than 115% of the area median income are eligible for USDA loans. In addition, the loan can only be put toward a property in a specific USDA-approved rural or suburban area. (The USDA provides an eligibility map that indicates the eligible areas.) The free structure for a USDA loan is also slightly different: Instead of private mortgage insurance, borrowers pay an upfront guarantee fee an annual fee.\n",

      "Here are some of the most common types of mortgages you can apply for. Conventional mortgage The most common type of home loan, a conventional mortgage is offered by a private lender, such as a bank or credit union. Conventional loans typically require a down payment between 5% and 20%. FHA loan An FHA loan is still issued by a private lender but it's backed by the Federal Housing Administration. It usually requires a smaller down payment, typically 3.5% with a credit score of 580 or 10% with a score of 500. Jumbo loan A jumbo loan exceeds the limits on mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The conforming loan limit in 2024 is $766,550 in most parts of the U.S., although some high-price areas have limits up to $1,149,825. VA loan A VA loan is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. It may be issued by a partner bank or credit union or by the VA directly. These loans usually don't require a down payment but you must be an active service member, a veteran or a surviving spouse to be approved. USDA loan A USDA loan is backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and doesn't require a down payment or mortgage insurance. Applicants must meet income requirements, however, and the funds must be used to buy a home in a qualifying rural or suburban area.\n",

      "FAQs What is an origination fee? An origination fee is charged by a mortgage lender to cover the cost of processing your loan. Origination fees may be lumped in with other upfront costs or waived in exchange for a higher interest rate or some other adjustment to your loan. How much are origination fees? Origination fees are commonly between 0.5% and 1% of your total loan amount. Some lenders charge a fixed amount, regardless of the size of the mortgage. What are lender fees? Lender fees is an umbrella term referring to the various charges associated with processing, approving and funding your loan. These are essentially a subset of closing costs and can include an origination fee, processing fee, underwriting fee and more. How much of a down payment do I need to make? In January 2024, the median down payment was 14.2%, according to data from the real estate data analysis firm ATTOM. You can get a conventional loan with as little as 3% down, however, but down payments of less than 20% often require private mortgage insurance, which can equal 0.50% of your total loan.\n",

      "To determine which mortgage lenders are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. mortgages offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you'll lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

We also opted for lenders with an online resource hub or advice center to help you educate yourself about the personal loan process and your finances. Minimum down payment: Although minimum down payment amounts depend on the type of loan a borrower applies for, we noted lenders that offer additional specialty loans that come with a lower minimum down payment amount. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for mortgages fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your mortgage agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan, unless you choose to refinance your mortgage at a later date for a potentially lower APR. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history, creditworthiness, debt-to-income ratio and the desired loan term. To take out a mortgage, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "\n",
      "The FICO credit score you need for approval depends on the type of mortgage. Conventional loan Conventional mortgages make up nearly three-quarters of all home loans. While lenders typically want to see a FICO score of 620 or better, there are options for borrowers with lower credit scores. Some will also consider nontraditional sources, like your banking history or on-time bill payments. FHA loans Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, FHA loans typically require a credit score of 500 and a 10% down payment. If you have a score of 580 or better, however, you can put down just 3.5%. VA loans Insured by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, VA loans are available to current and former service members and their spouses. While the VA doesn't set any credit score requirements, most lenders will want a 620. USDA loans A USDA loan is insured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is meant for low- to moderate-income borrowers buying a home in a designated rural or suburban area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The USDA doesn't set a minimum credit score requirement, though most lenders will want borrowers to have at least a 620. Jumbo loan A jumbo loan exceeds the limits for mortgages set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which means they can't be insured by FHA or bought by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Since that puts lenders at increased risk, they require a higher credit score — typically a 700.\n",

      "FAQs What credit score do I need to get a mortgage? Lenders typically want a credit score of 620 for a conventional loan. Because they're backed by the government, however, FHA loans are available to borrowers with scores as low as 500, though they will have to make a larger down payment. What credit score do I need to get the best mortgage rate? Lenders set their own rates and weigh credit scores differently. Typically, a FICO score of 760 will qualify you for the best rates. What is considered fair credit? Using FICO, a fair credit score is between 580 and 669. A fair score with VantageScore is between 601 and 660. Depending on where you fall in that range, you may meet the 620 score requirement lenders generally set for conventional loans — although you won't qualify for the best rates. How can I get a mortgage with bad credit? There are several mortgages with lower credit requirements, including VA and FHA loans, though they typically have income or service requirements. Another option is non-qualified mortgages, which don't meet the standards set by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They have laxer credit standards and can help borrowers who have been denied approval for a mortgage, have a nontraditional income stream or lack a credit history in the U.S.\n",

      "What is an adjustable-rate mortgage?\n",
      "\n",
      "An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has a rate that fluctuates over set intervals. During the initial repayment period, which is typically between five and ten years, your rate will stay the same. It will probably be lower than the rate you'd get with a fixed-rate mortgage. The trade-off, however, is that once the introductory phase ends, your rate adjusts every six or 12 months for the remainder of your term. Those rate changes are tied to market fluctuations, so if there's a drop in the benchmark index your lender selects when your ARM resets, your rate will go down. If there's an increase in that benchmark, however, that rate will go up. Your mortgage offer will detail your initial interest rate and the frequency of rate fluctuations. After closing, the only way to change these terms is to refinance to another ARM or to a fixed-rate mortgage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pro tip: Adjustable-rate mortgages are listed as fractions ARM terms are typically listed as a fraction — the top number is your fixed introductory period and the lower figure is the frequency at which the rate will fluctuate afterward. A 5/1 ARM, for example, has a set rate for five years and then it resets every year. A 5/6 ARM has a five-year fixed period, then adjusts every six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "FAQ How is an adjustable-rate mortgage different from a fixed-rate mortgage? Fixed-rate mortgages maintain the same interest rate over the loan's term. Adjustable-rate mortgages have a fixed rate for a set number of years. After that, the rate resets every six months or year. Who is an adjustable-rate mortgage good for? ARMs can benefit a variety of homebuyers, especially if you don't expect to stay in the house for more than a few years. If you have a 7/1 ARM and plan on selling within four years, you would benefit from the lower initial rate. If you expect rates to drop by the time your initial fixed phase expires, an ARM could also be a good idea. What is the main downside of an adjustable-rate mortgage? The biggest risk of an ARM is that, after the initial fixed-rate period expires, your rate could increase, pushing up your monthly mortgage payment.\n",

      "If you’re struggling with bad credit, you may stumble upon credit repair companies that boast the ability to clean up your credit report. These companies often target consumers with less-than-stellar credit and debt, hoping to acquire your business when you’re down on your luck. While signing up for a credit repair service can seem like a simple solution to your credit issues, these companies charge fees that can put you in more of a predicament. With just a little research and time out of your schedule, you may find you can easily dispute errors on your own at no cost. Before you work with a credit repair company, consider exactly what they offer and at what cost, as well as how you can clean up your credit for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is credit repair?\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit repair is the process of hiring a company to fix your bad credit through the removal of inaccurate, negative information on your credit reports. A credit repair company works on your behalf to remove this information by communicating with the credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) and/or financial companies, like your bank or a debt collector, to dispute the errors. There can be a lot of back and forth, but the end goal is to have negative information deleted from your credit file so your credit rating improves. Credit repair companies don't help you manage your money, which is a different service offered by credit counseling companies like the National Federation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) and the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA).\n",
      "\n",
      "How much does credit repair cost?\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit repair services aren’t free, but you won’t incur a fee until services are delivered. Fees are charged in one of two ways: monthly or per item removed from your credit report. Monthly subscriptions charge you for services provided during the previous 30 days, while the latter only charges you once info is removed from your credit file. The exact fees vary by service, but they can add up to hundreds or thousands of dollars every year.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to watch out for with credit repair companies\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit repair services aren’t always reliable or truthful. In fact, the CFPB found that more than half of people who submitted complaints about credit repair companies cited “fraud or scam.” Thankfully, there are consumer protections. If you opt to use a credit repair company, you’re protected under the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA), which regulates how these companies can operate. Some key points include: Consumers have three business days to cancel a contract without charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies can’t guarantee that they can remove information from your credit reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies can’t advise you to make false statements or change your identity to prevent the credit bureaus from associating information with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumers can’t be charged any fee for services that haven’t been fully rendered. Before signing up for any credit repair service, make sure they follow the CROA rules and look out for possible red flags, such as payments being demanded upfront or results that sound too good to be true. The CFPB lists more ways to avoid being misled by credit repair companies. And better yet, dispute any errors on your credit report on your own. There is no fee to clean up your credit and you’ll avoid misleading companies that may take advantage of your poor credit standing. Remember that even if you pay to have information removed from your credit report, there's no guarantee that it'll boost your credit score.\n",

      "When you're ready to purchase a new coat from Neiman Marcus or a new iPhone from Apple, you have the option of financing the cost of your order over time with buy now, pay later. BNPL, also known as point-of-sale loans, is kind of like a modern-day layaway option: Consumers can buy items online or in-store, and then split up the cost of a purchase over a few weeks or a few months with regular installment payments rather than pay for the entire purchase up front. There are many BNPL providers that have emerged in the past few years, and consumers are increasingly flocking to them to finance everything from clothing to travel to workout equipment. As long as you make your payments on time, BNPL services can also help you build credit. With so many buy now, pay later options available to consumers, which provider is best? And for who? When compiling this round-up of popular BNPL options, CNBC Select looked at factors like APR, late fees, available merchants, whether a credit check is performed and if the provider reports to the credit bureaus to help you determine which provider is best for you.

      "Who's this for? Affirm is a good choice if you need a longer-term financing option with a 0% APR and no late fees. It offers POS loans ranging from one to 60 months with a limit of $25,000 per loan. Affirm is one of the few buy now, pay later providers that offer consumers long-term financing options with a 0% APR. However, the interest rate that you manage to secure on your loan depends on a variety of factors — including the purchase amount, length of payment term and the merchant — so you could end up with an APR as high as 36%. If you manage to secure a 0% loan, you also don't have to worry about late fees, which is rare. However, if you're late with payments, you might not able to get a loan from Affirm in the future, and it could potentially affect your credit score. Affirm uses a soft credit check when approving consumers for loans. It also reports some loans to the credit bureau Experian. It doesn't report 0% four-biweekly payment loans or 0% loans with a three-month repayment period. Your payment history, how much credit you've used, late payments and how long you've had the credit line open can affect your credit score. Affirm is a good choice because of its widespread availability: You can essentially use it on any purchase anywhere by using the Affirm website or the app. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of merchants that partner with Affirm, consumers are able to use the BNPL option at any retailer, either online or in-store, that aren't integrated with the company through Affirm's website or mobile app. Consumers will receive a single-use virtual card through the website or the app to pay for their purchases wherever they want. While the Better Business Bureau gives Affirm an A- rating (you can read more about the BBB rating process here), customer reviews are not so good. It has a 1.16/5 average rating based on over 700 customer reviews on the BBB website at the time of writing. The customer complaints range from not being able to get ahold of customer service to not being able to obtain a refund.\n",

      "Who's this for? Afterpay doesn't consider itself a POS loan provider because it doesn't charge interest on its loans, but it is commonly referred to as a buy now, pay later provider so we've included them in this round-up. Afterpay is best for people who can make their payments on time, need a short-term financing option with 0% interest and don't want the loan to affect their credit score. The company offers one product: a financing option with four installment payments due every two weeks over a six-week term. You make one down payment at the time of purchase (typically 25% of the order) and then pay the rest over six weeks. There isn't a limit on how much credit you can take out with Afterpay. Your credit limit depends on how long you've been an Afterpay customer, and whether you're making your payments on time and in full. A new user will likely have a lower limit than someone with a long history, so if it's your first time using Afterpay, you might have to stick with purchasing smaller-ticket items. The average Afterpay order is only $150. One major advantage of using Afterpay, over other POS providers, is that it doesn't affect your credit score at all — the company doesn't check your credit score, and it doesn't report any loan information to the credit bureaus. A major drawback of using Afterpay are the late fees. You'll be hit with an $8 fee, or 25% of your transaction, whichever is less, for each late payment. If you fail to make a payment, you won't have access to the platform to take out a new loan until you make a payment. When it comes to availability, Afterpay can be used at more than 100,000 merchants around the world including American Eagle, Bed Bath and Beyond and lululemon. Afterpay also offers some consumers the ability to use the app to make purchases at select retailers such as Nike, Kroger, Amazon and Macy's. Whenever you use the app, you'll be given a one-time virtual card. Much like the other POS providers in this round-up, Afterpay has poor customer service reviews on the Better Business Bureau website. It had a 1.17/5 average rating based on 398 customer reviews at the time of writing. Many of the customer complaints focused on canceled orders from the merchant or failure to receive a refund from Afterpay. BBB gives Afterpay a B rating based on its own rating system.\n",

Sezzle, a Minneapolis-based buy now, pay later provider, is best for people who want a short-term loan, no interest, no reporting to the credit bureaus and flexible payment dates. It's one of the few BNPL providers that allow customers to reschedule one payment per purchase. Sezzle offers short-term and long-term financing options. Its short-term financing option is a six-week loan where consumers make a down payment and bi-weekly installment payments on purchases up to $2,500. If you choose to reschedule a payment, you could pay off your loan over two months. The long-term financing option, known as Sezzle + Ally, allows consumers to finance purchases worth up to $40,000 with a loan length of up to 60 months (your payments are monthly with this option). However, you may have to pay interest for this option. While Sezzle technically doesn't charge late fees, you will get charged 'failed payment' fees if your card is expired or you have insufficient funds on your debit card or in your bank account. This fee can be up to $10, but it depends on state regulations. Sezzle has over 40,000 partner merchants, but it's not connected with as many well-known or popular retailers as other BNPL providers. You can use the service both in-person and online, but you're limited to using it at partner merchants. You just sign up for Sezzle virtual card through the app and then add it to your Google Pay or Apple Pay and use it at checkout like you would any other virtual card. Sezzle only has a few reviews on BBB but they're mostly negative. They have a 1.21/5 average rating based on 110 customer reviews at the time of writing.

Zip is a good choice for consumers who want to use a BNPL option wherever they shop and don't want it to affect their credit score. Zip has one product that's similar to Afterpay: consumers can make a purchase and pay it off in four interest‑free installment payments over six weeks. Much like PayPal 'Pay in 4', Zip has a value limit on orders, so you can generally only spend up to $1,500 (but maximum amounts vary by retailer). Much like the other BNPL providers, Zip doesn't report these loans to the credit bureaus. It also doesn't perform any credit checks before approving customers for a loan. One of the major perks of Zip is how easy it is to use at most retailers. Zip is connected to over 51,000 merchants globally, including Sears, Target, Apple, Zara and ASOS, and customers can also use the app or the browser extension to shop at retailers that are not integrated with Zip. Whenever you use the app or the browser extension, you'll receive a virtual, one-time card to fund your purchase either in-store or online. That means you can use Zip to pay for dinner or groceries in person as well as for your online clothing orders. However, Zip does come with one major drawback: It's the only BNPL provider we reviewed that charges a convenience fee. Zip charges customers $1 per payment they make or a $4 fee for their order. There is some flexibility with payment due dates. If a customer is one day late for payment or has a delayed paycheck, Zip may move payment due dates if you contact the company and request more time. Of the BNPL providers that we reviewed, Zip also has the highest customer satisfaction rating with the BBB with a 4.2/5 average rating based on over 1,000 customer reviews at the time of writing.

      "Who's this for? PayPal is a global financial technology system known for its online payment system. It launched its own buy now, pay later product known as \"Pay in 4,\" which is a good option for people looking for a short-term financing option with 0% interest, no late fees that aren't reported to the credit bureaus. PayPal's 'Pay in 4' allows consumers to make four installment payments due every two weeks over a six-week period. The first payment, like a down payment, is due at the time of purchase. Consumers are limited to taking out loans of less than $1,500, so it's not a great choice if you're looking to finance a really expensive purchase. What distinguishes PayPal's 'Pay in 4' from other short-term BNPL providers Afterpay, is that it doesn't charge any late fees. It also does not report to the credit bureaus, so it won't affect your credit score. When it comes to determining your eligibility for a loan, PayPal doesn't check your credit score most of the time. It will, however, occasionally perform a soft credit check. According to a representative at PayPal, the company uses \"vast consumer data to understand an applicant's creditworthiness.\" PayPal 'Pay in 4', unlike the other BNPL providers on the list, doesn't have a separate app, or browser extension or website that allows consumers to use the service at online or in-store retailers not integrated with the company. PayPal does, however, have the advantage of being an established, multinational financial technology company, so it has millions of merchants available such as Uniqlo, Estee Lauder, Target and Best Buy. Since 'Pay in 4' is one of many products offered by PayPal, it doesn't have a separate BBB customer service rating.\n",

      "Buy now, pay later vs. credit cards\n",
      "\n",
      "The main advantage to using a buy now, pay later service, as opposed to paying with a credit card, is that they often don't charge interest and are easier to be approved for, though they typically require an upfront deposit. Meanwhile, credit cards stand out for usually offering some form of rewards — either cash-back, points or miles — and being more widely accepted. Although credit card interest charges can become expensive, there are a number of 0% APR credit cards that offer no interest for a period of time. Further, credit cards allow you to pay off purchases at your own pace, as opposed to a set number of fixed payments. Some credit card issuers now also offer BNPL-like options, such as the Plan It® feature from American Express, My Chase Plan and Citi Flex Pay. If you a prefer a 0% APR credit card over a BNPL service, here are some of our top picks to consider:\n",

      "FAQs When are taxes due? Federal income tax returns are due on April 15, 2024. However, Maine and Massachusetts residents will have until April 17, 2024, due to state holidays. When are quarterly estimated tax payments? While you must submit a tax return by the filing date every year, you may also need to file your taxes quarterly and make estimated tax payments. The IRS generally requires small business owners to make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe a minimum of $1,000. Filing quarterly isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all, it allows you to make four smaller tax payments versus one large tax payment. Here's when estimated tax payments are due: First quarter (January 1 to March 31): April 15\n",
      "\n",
      "April 15 Second quarter (April 1 to May 31): June 17\n",
      "\n",
      "June 17 Third quarter (June 1 to August 31): September 16\n",
      "\n",
      "September 16 Fourth quarter (September 1 to December 31): January 15 of the following year How can you make estimated tax payments? You can make estimated tax payments through some online tax software, the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) or by mailing in a completed 1040-ES form with your payment. If you mail in your payment, it must be postmarked by the due date to avoid penalties. What happens if I miss the tax deadline? If you miss the April 18 deadline, file your taxes as soon as possible. You may incur a fee if you file late, and it only gets pricier the longer you wait. If you file late and owe taxes, you’ll incur a fee. However, you won’t incur a penalty if you don’t owe and instead have a tax refund coming. That said, there’s no way to know if you’ll owe taxes or not, so it’s important to file on time. How much does it cost to file taxes? Most small business owners will have to pay for their tax prep. Unlike with individual tax returns, there are very few free programs.\n",

      "Customer reviews, when available Cost was one of the most important factors. While one of the services offers free federal filing, many business owners may want to benefit from robust software, therefore paying to file their taxes. We evaluated the price per plan and weighed the features you receive, like the ability to maximize deductions and credits. The more bang for your buck, the higher a service ranked. Whether you’re new to filing taxes or a seasoned pro, user experience is crucial to filling out and submitting your return quickly and with little frustration. The services we chose had to be relatively user friendly. The ability to speak with a tax expert or support representative was a big plus. All five of the best tax software offered some form of support. And if a service supported consumers with a generous accuracy and maximum refund guarantee, it was ranked higher. We also considered the Better Business Bureau rating associated with the software. BBB ratings help determine whether a business is operating responsibly and if it helps to resolve customer complaints promptly. Customer reviews were also taken into consideration. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall tax filing, runner-up, free tax software, most affordable and best accuracy guarantee. The federal and state filing fees for the software programs mentioned above are subject to change without notice. Many programs don’t charge you until you file, so there’s a chance the fees can change from the time you start your return until you submit it.

      "If you earn $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less if married filing jointly) you can claim $2,500 for qualified tuition costs, school fees, and course materials. The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit: Worth up to $7,500 if you purchase an eligible EV. Deduct student loan interest While tax credits directly reduce your tax bill, tax deductions lower your taxable income by letting you subtract certain expenses. If you, your spouse or a dependent have federal or private student loans, for example, you can deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest each year. This write-off begins to phase out if your modified adjusted gross income hits $70,000, however, and disappears entirely at $90,000. If you're married and filing jointly, the phaseout starts at $155,000 and disappears if you earn $185,000 or more. Max out your retirement fund You can also claim deductions for contributions to qualifying pre-tax retirement accounts like an employer-sponsored 401(k) or traditional IRA. With pre-tax contributions, you're taking less out of your paycheck now. Because your money is growing tax-deferred, however, you'll pay income tax on it when you start withdrawing. Contribute to a health savings account if you have a high-deductible healthcare plan, a health savings account (HSA) allows you to save for upcoming medical expenses. Contributions are tax-free (or tax-deductible if self-funded) and the balance can grow tax-free through investments. Withdrawals are also tax-free if used for eligible expenses — like deductibles or copays, prescriptions, medical devices and even birth control. Some companies also offer flexible spending accounts (FSA), which lower your taxable income by allowing pre-tax contributions. FSAs don't let you invest, however, and the funds generally don't roll over to the following year. Sell losing stocks If you own stocks that performed badly this year, you can use your losses to offset the taxes you would pay on other investment gains — a process called tax-loss harvesting. If you have no capital gains this year, your losses can offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income — anything beyond that can carry over and be used to lower taxes. in the future.\n",

      "FAQs How do tax brackets work? Tax brackets are the various tiers your income is taxed at. You only pay a higher rate on the portion of your income that falls into that bracket, not your entire paycheck. If you earned $40,000 in 2024, for example, the first $11,600 of your income would be taxed at 10% ($1,160) while the next $13,800 would be taxed at 12% ($1,656). Your total tax liability would be $2,816. How do I calculate my tax bracket? To calculate your tax bracket, determine your total taxable income after deductions. Then, match that income to the corresponding range in the tax bracket chart for your filing status to see the rate that applies to each portion of your income. Your taxable income will likely span multiple brackets depending on how much you've earned. Does a Roth IRA put you in a different tax bracket? A Roth IRA doesn't change your tax bracket because contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you've already paid taxes on the money. What is the highest tax bracket? The highest tax bracket is currently 37%. For tax year 2025, only single filers earning at least $626,350 (or married couples filing jointly earning at least $751,600) will pay that rate on any portion of their income. Wit the TCJA sunsetting in 2025, however, the highest bracket could be 39.6% in 2026 What is the standard deduction for 2025? For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately for tax year 2025, the standard deduction is $15,000, an increase of $400 from 2024. For married couples filing jointly, it's $30,000, up $800 from 2024. For heads of households, it's $22,500, up $600 from 2024.\n",

      "Who's this for? If you have bad credit and have struggled to be approved for cards in the past, you may want to consider a card that doesn't perform a credit check. The OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card doesn't pull your credit when you apply. Like other secured cards, a minimum $200 security deposit is required to open the card and you can deposit up to $3,000. While this card is great for no credit check, it does come with a $35 annual fee, unlike the other cards mentioned above that have no annual fee.

      "Who's this for? The Discover it® Secured Credit Card is a well-rounded secured card that offers many of the benefits that are typically found with unsecured cards. Cardholders can earn cash back, receive a generous welcome bonus, use the card overseas without incurring added fees and more — all for no annual fee. Cardholders earn a competitive 2% cash back at Gas Stations and Restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter, automatically. Plus earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. The welcome bonus is also unique: For new card members in the first year only, Discover will automatically match all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year. If you earn $25 cash back at the end of the first year, Discover will give you an additional $25. This card requires a $200 security deposit, which is fairly standard for secured credit cards. It stands out from the crowd because cardholders have a clear path to upgrading to an unsecured card (and getting their deposit back). Starting at seven months from account opening, Discover will automatically review your credit card account to see if they can transition you to an unsecured line of credit and return your deposit. This takes the guesswork out of wondering when you'll qualify for an unsecured credit card. [ Return to card summary ]\n",

If you qualify for the low $49 or $99 deposits, you'll still receive a $200 credit limit. This is a great feature considering many secured cards require $200 deposits to receive an equivalent line of credit. By using your card responsibly and making on-time payments, you may be able to improve your credit score and be considered for a credit line increase in as little as six months.

There is a higher-than-average $500 minimum security deposit to open the card. But it does come with some additional perks, including travel insurance, auto rental collision damage waiver and extended warranty protection. Membership to the Digital Federal Credit Union is required, but anyone can join in one of several ways: if you're a friend or family member of a DCU member, live in select communities, work for select employers or make a one-time contribution (as low as $10) to a participating organization.

      "\n",
      "To determine which credit cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed 234 of the most popular credit cards available in the U.S. We compared each card on a range of features, including: annual fee, minimum security deposit, credit limit, rewards program, introductory and standard APR, welcome bonuses and foreign transaction fees, as well as factors such as required credit score and customer reviews when available. We also took into account how easy it is to upgrade the card from secured to unsecured and how quickly you can get your security deposit back. Because it's unusual for secured credit cards to have robust rewards programs, we did not analyze how many rewards points you can earn in the first year. For cardholders who are looking to rebuild credit, it's more important to practice good credit card habits — spending within your means, paying your balance on time and in full — than try to optimize your points balance.

Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount.

Scores lower than 670, and certainly scores lower than 600, will most likely disqualify you for the most affordable personal loans.

Plus, checking your credit report for errors and disputing them might have a positive effect on your scores.\n",

Using a co-signer or co-borrower: If a family member or trusted friend has a good credit score, you can ask them to be a co-signer or co-borrower on your loan. Co-signers have no access to loan funds or payment information but agree to repay the loan if the borrower fails to make payments. Co-borrowers, on the other hand, can access the funds and payment information and are also responsible for the loan and any missed or late payments. Note that if you don't repay the loan as agreed, your co-borrower's or co-signer's credit will be negatively impacted along with yours.\n",

Adding collateral: You can secure your personal loan by adding collateral. For example, you might be able to pledge your car or money in your savings account as collateral. If you fail to repay the loan, the lender has the right to take your collateral. This makes a secured personal loan risky but also more accessible to borrowers with low credit scores.\n",

      "Alternatives to high-interest loans\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad credit might stop you from qualifying for credit products like 0% APR credit cards or low-interest personal loans. If you want to avoid paying high interest rates, you can look into the following alternatives: Peer-to-peer (P2P) loans: P2P loans are offered by individual investors rather than financial institutions. These lenders might be more willing to work with borrowers with lower credit scores and offer lower interest rates.\n",

      "P2P loans are offered by individual investors rather than financial institutions.

Life insurance policy loan: If you have life insurance, you can borrow from its cash value using your policy as collateral. Typically, this type of loan doesn't require a credit check and might offer more favorable terms than a personal loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have life insurance, you can borrow from its cash value using your policy as collateral. Typically, this type of loan doesn't require a credit check and might offer more favorable terms than a personal loan. 401(k) loan: You may be able to borrow money from your workplace retirement account. You'll have to repay it with interest, but the interest will go back into your 401(k) account along with balance payments. This type of loan also usually doesn't have a minimum credit requirement. Note, however, that a 401(k) loan should be one of the last resort options as the money you borrow from your retirement account loses the potential to keep growing over time, decreasing your future retirement savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the difference between secured vs. unsecured loans?\n",
      "\n",
      "A secured loan is a loan backed by collateral. The most common types of secured loans are mortgages and car loans, where the collateral is your home or car. But really, collateral can be any kind of financial asset you own. And if you don't pay back your loan, the bank can seize your collateral as payment. A repossession stays on your credit report for up to seven years. An unsecured loan requires no collateral, though you're still charged interest and sometimes fees. Student loans, personal loans and credit cards are all examples of unsecured loans. Since there's no collateral, financial institutions give out unsecured loans based in large part on your credit score, income and history of repaying past debts. For this reason, unsecured loans may have higher interest rates (but not always) than a secured loan.\n",

Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "Who's this for? Achieve is an excellent debt consolidation loan option for those with imperfect credit, thanks to its flexible terms, fast approval, quick funding and relatively reasonable interest rates. To qualify for a personal loan from Achieve, you'll need a credit score of 620, which is considered fair. You can see whether you're likely to be approved when you apply online: Achieve will perform a soft credit inquiry, meaning it won't impact your score. If you opt to proceed with your application after pre-approval, the company will do a hard credit check that might ding you a few credit points. Achieve offers same-day approvals and can then send funds within 24 to 72 hours. If your credit leaves a lot to be desired, you're more likely to qualify for an interest rate on the higher end of the APR range. Most debt consolidation loans for bad credit can charge interest of up to 36%, but Achieve's highest interest rate is considerably lower.\n",

      "Can I apply for debt consolidation with bad credit?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's possible to qualify for a debt consolidation loan with bad credit (a credit score of under 670). However, it's important to pay attention to the terms. Interest rates on personal loans for poor credit may at times exceed APRs on credit cards, especially if you apply with a low credit score. When that's the case, taking out a loan to get rid of your debt might not be the best option. Instead, consider other ways to tackle your balances. For instance, you might be able to negotiate repayment terms with your current creditors. It can also be a good idea to look into credit counseling and get help creating a debt management plan. Don't miss: The best personal loans if you have bad credit but still need access to cash\n",
      "\n",
      "Why can't I get a debt consolidation loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with debt consolidation loans for bad credit, approval isn't guaranteed. Lenders typically look at multiple factors when evaluating a loan application. For example, you might be denied if you don't meet income requirements or if your debt-to-income ratio is too high. Note that any lender that denies your credit application must disclose the specific reasons it has turned you down within 60 days under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the downside to consolidating debt?\n",
      "\n",
      "Debt consolidation might be an excellent debt repayment strategy but it's not perfect for everyone. Here are some disadvantages to consider: You may end up with a higher interest rate. This is especially true if you have less-than-ideal credit. Or, even if you get a lower APR, you might still pay more in interest if you've picked a long loan term.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is especially true if you have less-than-ideal credit. Or, even if you get a lower APR, you might still pay more in interest if you've picked a long loan term. You may pay upfront costs. Debt consolidation loans typically charge loan origination fees which can run high if you're dealing with a large debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Debt consolidation loans typically charge loan origination fees which can run high if you're dealing with a large debt. You might be tempted to continue spending. Merging multiple balances into one loan may feel like a weight off your shoulders. However, if you know you have trouble living below your means or saving enough, you might fall back into your old patterns once you feel free of debt. To avoid that, be disciplined about your budget and make a point to prioritize debt repayment.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does it take to get approved for a debt consolidation loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "You can expect to receive the lender's decision within a few business days. However, many lenders might also approve you instantly. For a smooth process, make sure you provide any documentation the lender requires with your application and promptly respond to requests for more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to choose the best debt consolidation loan\n",
      "\n",
      "Shopping around is crucial when you're choosing a lender or financial product. When determining the best debt consolidation loan for you, look beyond the APRs. While the interest rate is often the deciding factor, you should also pay attention to other costs associated with the loan. For instance, some lenders charge origination fees which can get as high as 10% of the loan amount. Additionally, pay attention to extra features and user experience the lender offers. For example, do they provide a convenient way for the borrower to manage their loan virtually? Is there an option to chat with customer service online? And finally, it can be helpful to read customer reviews on websites like the Better Business Bureau to ensure the lender offers a solid level of service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatives to debt consolidation\n",
      "\n",
      "A debt consolidation loan might be hard to secure if you have credit issues, and even then, the terms might not be favorable. Some alternatives to debt consolidation you can look into include: Mortgage refinancing : If you have a mortgage, you may be able to replace it with a new larger one and use the difference to consolidate debt. This type of loan is called \"cash-out refinance\". Note that most lenders require a credit score of at least 620 to qualify.\n",

Negotiating with your lenders: When managing your debt becomes challenging, don't be afraid to reach out to your lenders and credit card issuers. While not guaranteed, they may be able to offer help. For example, they may agree to lower your interest rate, develop a payment plan or provide other arrangements to make your loan more manageable. It's always best to keep open communication with your financial institutions.\n",

It's always best to keep open communication with your financial institutions. Credit counseling: In a credit counseling program, a certified financial expert will take an in-depth look at your finances and offer steps to improve your situation. For instance, they may recommend a debt management program where the credit counseling organization would develop a payment plan with your lenders for you. The most reputable organizations are nonprofits and don't charge for their services (or require a low fixed rate). You can search for a credit counseling provider at the National Federation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) and the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA).\n",

Debt relief: Debt relief companies can also negotiate what you owe with your creditors for a fee. However, debt settlement comes with potential risks as it requires that you stop making payments while the negotiation is in process. This can cause a huge hit to your credit score. Even worse, some lenders may try to sue you. Keeping this in mind, you might want to consider debt settlement the last-resort option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line\n",
      "\n",
      "Consolidating debt may be a difficult task if your credit score isn't perfect. Luckily, it's still possible to qualify for a debt consolidation loan even with a low score. It's important to do the math before taking out a debt consolidation loan. Check the APR before applying if the lender offers this option and factor in origination fees to determine whether a debt consolidation loan will save you money. If not, you might be better off finding a different strategy to deal with your debt.\n",

Some lenders (which we noted) offer the ability to pay your creditors directly. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $50,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "Who's this for? While SoFi generally accepts good or excellent credit for its personal loan products, borrowers can apply for a loan using a co-applicant. A co-applicant can be beneficial for someone who has damaged or poor credit or a credit history that's so insufficient that they likely may not be approved for the loan if they applied alone. An ideal co-applicant will have a higher credit score and higher income. These attributes tell lenders that the borrowers are more likely to be able to afford to repay the loan. The co-applicant is also financially on the hook for repaying the loan if the other co-applicant fails to make payments. SoFi doesn't charge any late fees, or early payoff fees. And, you can borrow between $5,000 to $100,000, which makes SoFi an attractive option for people who need to borrow larger amounts for bigger expenses. You can get your loan funded the same day, or the next business day, providing you don't need to apply with additional information.

You can apply for loan amounts as low as $1,000 and as much as $50,000. The $1,000 minimum makes the loan feel a little more accessible for those who don't need to borrow too much money. It's generally best to only apply for what you'll need since borrowing more will result in higher monthly payments. And while there are no penalties for paying off your balance early, Upstart does charge an origination fee (up to 12% of the amount you borrow) and late fees ($15 or 5% of the past due balance, whichever is greater). When it comes to repaying the balance, loan terms range from 36 to 60 months, which can be appealing to borrowers who think they may need a longer time horizon to repay the entire loan.\n",

Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees.

      "Who's this for? OneMain Financial offers loan options that are much less rigid compared to other lenders. Borrowers can take advantage of repayment terms between 24 months and 60 months. This lender generally approves applicants with at least a poor or fair credit score but, like SoFi, you may be able to get a co-applicant on board to improve your chances of approval if you have insufficient credit history. Another thing that makes this lender a little more flexible is the ability to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured. But with secured loans, a borrower essentially uses another asset as a \"promise\" that if they fail to repay their loan in full, the lender can seize that asset from them as collateral. Not only does OneMain Financial give you this option, but doing so also lets you potentially receive an even lower interest rate. Plus, borrowers can actually choose the date their monthly payments are due. The origination fee is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state).\n",

      "To determine which personal loans are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with no origination or signup fees, fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.\n",

      "OneMain Financial offers borrowers with less-than-perfect credit access to financial products like loans and credit cards. It stands out for allowing you to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured debt, meaning you can borrow the money outright without having to offer up something of value. But with secured loans, you agree to sign over an asset (such as your car) to the lender if you fail to repay the loan. OneMain Financial gives certain borrowers the option to take out a secured personal loan, which can sometimes result in a lower interest rate than an unsecured loan. Plus, borrowers can choose the date their monthly payments are due. The origination fee with OneMain Financial is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you either $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state).

      "Can I pre-qualify without hurting my credit score?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to pre-qualify for a personal loan without hurting your credit score. Do some research before you apply. Read reviews and learn what to consider before agreeing to take on a loan. When you're ready to apply, follow these steps to ensure you don't ding your score too much. Shop around for the best rate. Avoid hard inquiries by knowing your credit score before you submit a formal application so you know what you might qualify for. Many lenders will allow you to submit a prequalification form. Or consider using a lending platform (such as Upstart or LendingTree) to view multiple offers at once. Decide on the best offer. Choose the loan with the best monthly payment and interest rate for your budget. Be sure to look at how much the loan will cost you over the full length of the term and decide if the cost is worth it. Submit a formal application. Have your social security number on hand, as well as supporting documents such as bank statements and paystubs. Wait for final approval. This could take just a few minutes, an hour or up to 10 days. To facilitate speedier approval, apply during normal business hours and submit the required documents right away. Get your funds. Once your loan is approved, you'll be asked to input your bank account information so the funds are deposited into your account. You may also be able to request a paper check from your lender, or in the case of a consolidation loan, you may be able to have funds sent right to your creditors.\n",

      "\n",
      "While FICO credit scores below 580 are considered poor, you still have access to traditional personal loans. All the lenders on this list accept applicants with bad credit scores but keep in mind you'll be subjected to higher interest rates and may only qualify for shorter loan repayment terms. If you have a low credit score, you can also qualify for payday loans, but this is generally only recommended as an absolute last resort. While payday loans approve applicants with subpar credit scores, they can also have triple-digit interest rates that can easily demolish your finances. It's better to exhaust all alternatives before even going near a payday loan.\n",

      "What is a good credit score for a personal loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most personal loan lenders consider good to excellent credit scores, which means a FICO score of at least 670. The higher your credit score, the more likely you'll be to get approved for the best personal loan rates.\n",

      "FAQs Can I get a personal loan with a 500 credit score? It is possible to get a personal loan with a 500 credit score, however, you're unlikely to receive favorable terms like a low interest rate. What is the easiest loan to get with bad credit? If you have bad credit, you may have an easier time qualifying for a secured personal loan that requires a co-signer. Or, you may seek out lenders that have a lower minimum credit score requirement. Can you pay off a personal loan early? It is advantageous to pay off a personal loan early since you'll save on interest charges. Just make sure the lender doesn't charge any prepayment penalties for paying off your loan early.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine which personal loans are the best for consumers with a credit score of 580 or lower, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible, we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "Who's this for? Sometimes, a potential borrower may have a low credit score because they have extremely limited credit activity. Other times, a lack of credit history may result in them having no credit score at all. Because of this, Upstart accepts applicants with no credit history — though this lender also looks at applicants with a FICO score of 300 or higher. Just keep in mind that if you are approved for the loan with a lower (or no) credit score, you may be subject to a higher interest rate. You can apply for loan amounts as low as $1,000 and as much as $50,000. And while there are no penalties for paying off your balance early, Upstart does charge an origination fee (up to 12% of the amount you borrow) and late fees ($15 or 5% of the past due balance, whichever is greater). When it comes to repaying the balance, loan terms range from 36 to 60 months, which can be appealing to borrowers who think they may need a longer time horizon to repay the entire loan.\n",

      "Who's this for? Upgrade typically looks at borrowers who have fair or good credit. With FICO, fair or good credit scores fall within the ranges of 580 to 739, and with VantageScore, fair or good ranges between 601 to 780. Many personal loan lenders offer amounts starting around $3,000 to $5,000, but with Upgrade, you can apply for as little as $1,000 (and as much as $50,000). The $1,000 minimum makes the loan feel a little more digestible for those who don't need to borrow too much money. This is especially important because it's generally best to only apply for what you'll need since borrowing more will result in higher monthly payments. Also keep in mind that Upgrade personal loans have an origination fee of up to 9.99%, which is deducted directly from your loan proceeds. So, if you know you'll need $1,000, you should account for the origination fee and apply for a loan amount closer to $1,080 to cover all your bases. Upgrade doesn't have any prepayment penalties, but it does have a late fee: If you pay late or miss a payment, you could be hit with a $10 late fee if your payment is not received in full within 15 calendar days of the due date. Otherwise, these loans are fast and easy to secure, and the funds should arrive in your checking account within one business day of submitting the required documents and being approved.\n",

Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees.

      "Who's this for? OneMain Financial offers loan options that are much less rigid compared to other lenders. This lender generally accepts applicants with at least a poor or fair credit score, but if you're worried your credit score will hurt your chances of securing a better interest rate, you may be able to submit your application with a co-applicant. Plus, borrowers can take advantage of repayment terms with a bit more flexibility compared to that of some lenders as terms range from 24 months to 60 months. Another feature that makes this lender a little more flexible is the ability to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured debt, meaning you can borrow the money outright without having to offer up something of value. But with secured loans, a borrower essentially uses another asset as a \"promise\" that if they fail to repay their loan in full, the lender can seize that asset from them as collateral. Not only does OneMain Financial give you this option, but doing so also lets you potentially receive an even lower interest rate. Plus, borrowers can actually choose the date their monthly payments are due. The origination fee with OneMain Financial is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you either $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state).

      "Who's this for? SoFi actually only considers applicants with good or excellent credit for its personal loan products. However, because this lender is very open to borrowers who need a co-applicant, it's still worth considering if your credit score is closer to the poor/fair range. A co-applicant on a personal loan can be beneficial for someone who has damaged credit, poor credit or a credit history that's so insufficient that they likely may not be approved for the loan if they applied alone. Or, sometimes a co-applicant can be used to give qualifying borrowers with an already good credit score an extra boost for securing better interest rates. An ideal co-applicant will have a higher credit score and higher income. These attributes tell lenders that the borrowers are more likely to be able to afford to repay the loan. The co-applicant is also financially on the hook for repaying the loan if the other co-applicant fails to make payments. SoFi doesn't charge any late fees or early payoff fees. And, you can borrow between $5,000 to $100,000, which makes SoFi an attractive option for people who need to borrow larger amounts for bigger expenses. You can get your loan funded the same day, or the next business day, provided you don't need to apply with additional information. Plus, when you sign up for a SoFi Personal Loan, you can join its membership platform to take advantage of a host of other perks like career counseling, financial advising and more.\n",

Avant is one personal loan lender that can typically provide funding as soon as the next business day after you're approved — of course, you'll need to be sure you have all the correct information handy and that you've accurately filled out your application to make sure you can receive funding without a hitch. Avant will consider applicants with credit scores under 600, but, again, we remind you that the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to receive the lowest, best rates. This lender also offers personal loan amounts as low as $2,000 and as high as $35,000.

      "Common personal loan definitions you should know\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some common personal loan terms you need to know before applying for one. Co-applicants or joint applications: A co-applicant is a broad term for another person who helps you qualify by attaching their name (and financial details) to your application. A co-applicant can be a co-signer or a co-borrower. Having a co-applicant can be helpful when you have a poor or fair credit score. If your co-applicant has a good credit score, you might be offered better terms, including qualifying for a lower APR and/or a bigger loan. However, both applicants' credit scores will be affected if you don't pay back your loan, so be sure that your co-applicant is someone you feel comfortable sharing financial responsibility with.\n",

However, both applicants' credit scores will be affected if you don't pay back your loan, so be sure that your co-applicant is someone you feel comfortable sharing financial responsibility with. Co-signers: A co-signer agrees to help you qualify for the loan, but they are only responsible for making payments if you are unable to. The co-signer does not receive the loan, nor do they necessarily make decisions about how it is used. However, the co-signers credit will be negatively affected if the main borrower misses payments or defaults.\n",

The co-signer does not receive the loan, nor do they necessarily make decisions about how it is used. However, the co-signers credit will be negatively affected if the main borrower misses payments or defaults. Co-borrower: Unlike a co-signer, a co-borrower is responsible for paying back the loan and deciding how it is used. Co-borrowers are usually involved in decisions about how the loan is used. Some lenders will only consider two co-borrowers who share a home or business address, as this is a firm indicator that they are sharing the responsibility of money in mutually beneficial ways. Both co-borrowers' credit scores are on the hook if either one stops making payments or defaults.\n",

Both co-borrowers' credit scores are on the hook if either one stops making payments or defaults. Direct payments: Some lenders offer direct payments when you select debt consolidation as the reason for taking out a personal loan. With direct payments, the lender pays your creditors directly, and then deposits any leftover funds into your checking or savings account. Until you see your account balance is fully paid off, it's best to keep making payments so that you don't get hit with additional late fees and interest charges.\n",

Until you see your account balance is fully paid off, it's best to keep making payments so that you don't get hit with additional late fees and interest charges. Early payoff penalty: Before you accept a loan, look to see if the lender charges an early payoff or prepayment penalty. Because lenders expect to get paid interest for the full term of your loan, they could charge you a fee if you make extra payments to pay your debt down quicker. The fees could equal either the remaining interest you would have owed, a percentage of your payoff balance or a flat rate.\n",

The fees could equal either the remaining interest you would have owed, a percentage of your payoff balance or a flat rate. Origination fee: An origination fee is a one-time upfront charge that your lender subtracts from your loan to pay for administration and processing costs. It is usually between 1% and 5%, but sometimes it is charged as a flat-rate fee. For example, if you took out a loan for $20,000 and there was a 5% origination fee, you would only receive $19,000 when you got your funds. Your lender would get $1,000 of the loan off the top , and you'd still have to pay back the full $20,000 plus interest. It's best to avoid origination fees if possible.\n",

Unsecured versus secured loans: Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning they are not tied to collateral. However, if your credit score is less-than-stellar and you're finding it hard to qualify for the best loans, you can sometimes use a car, house or other assets to act as collateral in case you default on your payments. When you put an asset up as collateral, you are giving your lender permission to repossess it if you don't pay back your debts on time and in full.\n",

      "Our methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine which personal loans are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

      "\n",
      "We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $500 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for having no credit history, borrowing smaller loan amounts, flexible terms, applying with a co-applicant and getting secured loan options. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. Before providing a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.\n",

      "\n",
      "Getting ready to apply for a mortgage? Raising your credit score is the first step. Pay bills on time Paying credit card bills and other debts on time is the most important thing you can do to raise your score. Your payment history is 35% of your FICO® score, making it the biggest determiner in your credit score. Paying the total amount due and not carrying a balance will keep your credit utilization rate low. (Experts recommend keeping your total utilization below 30%, but below 10% is even better.) Setting up autopay reduces the likelihood that you'll miss a payment. Don't open new lines of credit Getting a new credit card or taking out a personal loan can hurt your credit in a few ways: Applying will require a hard inquiry which can temporarily lower your score — and if you're approved, the average age of your accounts will drop. Request a credit limit increase One way to boost your credit score is to ask your credit card servicer to increase your credit limit. Provided you don't charge anything, that will increase your available credit and lower your credit utilization rate. Check for errors in your credit reports Some 44% of consumers have found errors in their credit reports, according to an April 2024 study from Consumer Reports. it's always smart to monitor your credit reports for inaccuracies, whether they're honest mistakes or signs of fraud. You can use Aura, IdentityForce or another credit monitoring service to survey your reports from Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What credit score do I need to get a mortgage? For a conventional mortgage, lenders typically want a credit score of 620. However, you'll need a score of 760 for the best rates. What kinds of mortgages are easier to get approved for? Government-backed mortgages — like FHA, USDA, and VA loans — typically have more flexible credit score requirements than conventional loans. However, they may have other limitations: VA loans are limited to current or former service members, for example, and USDA loans are only for individuals who meet income and location requirements. What is the lowest credit score to get approved for a mortgage? You can qualify for an FHA loan with a score as low as 500 if you make a down payment of at least 10%. Requirements vary by lender, however. What is a non-qualifying mortgage? A non-qualified mortgage (or non-QM loan) doesn't conform to income and credit requirements the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sets. Non-QM loans can help people with poor credit, unusual income streams or a bankruptcy in their past get a mortgage, although the interest rates are significantly higher.\n",

When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

      "TD Ameritrade, Inc. has been acquired by Charles Schwab, and all accounts have been moved. There are so many ways to invest your money to build your wealth. From stocks to bonds to index funds, there's a wide range of investment vehicles for every kind of investor depending on their goals. A common choice for beginner investors who want exposure to the overall stock market is to put money into an exchange-traded fund or ETF.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are ETFs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of ETFs as buckets that hold a collection of securities, like stocks and bonds. Because ETFs are made up of these multiple assets, they provide investors with instant diversification. When an investor purchases a share of an ETF, their money is spread across different investments. This differs from stocks where you buy shares of just a single company. ETFs typically mimic a market index like the S&P 500. Since ETF performance is usually based on an index — meaning they follow the ups and downs of said index — most are passively managed investments and thus likely have lower fees than mutual funds. Mutual funds, on the other hand, want to beat the market's performance and are thus managed by a fund manager, who's actively choosing the investments. Similar to stocks, ETFs can be bought and sold on an exchange throughout the day, and investors can even earn dividends depending on the type of index the fund tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should you invest in ETFs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Since ETFs offer built-in diversification and don't require large amounts of capital in order to invest in a range of stocks, they are a good way to get started. You can trade them like stocks while also enjoying a diversified portfolio. How to get started investing in ETFs First, you'll need to set up an online account through a broker or trading platform. After funding the account, you can purchase ETFs using their ticker symbol and indicating how many shares you want. Deciding on how many shares to buy largely depends on the current pricing of a share and your own financial situation. ETFs are good for beginners because they offer entry-level access: You can buy as little as a single share, and with some brokers, like Robinhood, you can even buy fractional shares. Fees vary by broker, but it's best to look for options with very low or no transaction costs. These days, many of the traditional brokerages offer commission-free trading on ETFs. Some of the best $0 commission trading platforms include the below: TD Ameritrade\n",

      "Fidelity Though ETFs tracking the S&P 500 are some of the most popular, be aware that very few ETFs track the S&P 500 as a whole, rather just components of the index. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks the entire index, and it has low management fees. Its current expense ratio is 0.03%, which means you pay just 30 cents per year for every $1,000 invested. For every $10,000 invested, that would equate to $3 per year.\n",

      "Bottom line\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't have to be so hands-on in order to invest with ETFs, and investing in them is an easy way to get started in the market. If you don't feel confident choosing ETFs, consider opening an account with a robo-advisor that automatically invests on your behalf. Many robo-advisors, like Betterment, recommend low-cost ETF portfolios so you can take advantage of this investing vehicle without having to do your research on all the different options available.\n",

      "### TEXT: \n",
      "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi shakes hands with former U.S. President Donald Trump before a meeting at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on February 25, 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donald Trump decisively won the U.S. presidential election, becoming one of only two American leaders who have retaken the keys to the White House after a spell out of office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as in 2016, investors are grappling with policy uncertainty surrounding his presidency and what might come in the following year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, the outcomes are likely to be vastly different from eight years ago — at least as far as India is concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturing\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign appears double-edged and at odds with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"Make in India\" initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taxes on goods imported from China into the U.S. will likely benefit India, most analysts say, as companies shift manufacturing to the South Asian nation to avoid duties. Global trade changed considerably over the past four years — benefiting India — as President Joe Biden retained much of Trump's tariffs on China.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Potential tariff or non-tariff barriers on Chinese imports in the U.S. and India's domestic manufacturing thrust with Make in India, could be positive for Indian [electronics manufacturing services] companies in areas like PCBs [electric circuits], semiconductors, mobile phones, cables and wires, among others,\" said Macquarie Capital's head of India research Aditya Suresh, citing cable and wire maker Polycab as an example of a stock that stands to benefit in this scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts also suggest that the benefits from supply chains reorienting, with companies basing themselves in India and out of China, will outweigh the impact of universal tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Trump took unilateral measures during his previous reign, targeting India with tariffs by removing the country from a special trade program known as the Generalized System of Preferences. About $5 billion worth of exports from India to the U.S. have had duties applied to them since 2019, according to the Observer Research Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tax rises and tax cuts\n",
      "\n",
      "Import duties can raise U.S. consumer prices and push up inflation alongside bond yields . Higher U.S. Treasury yields often usurp money away from emerging markets rapidly, including India, in today's viscous market environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why invest in high-risk equities overseas when Uncle Sam is offering 4.5% every year risk-free on your investment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign investors have already begun walking with their wallets, selling $1.5 billion worth of Indian stocks this month on top of the $11 billion in October. Last month, the Nifty 50 index fell by 6% and logged its worst monthly performance since March 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slashing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, if Republicans take control of both houses of Congress, will also boost U.S. stock markets. That makes it harder for Indian equities to outperform just as Mumbai-listed stocks start to struggle to meet earnings expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immigration\n",
      "\n",
      "President-elect Trump campaigned on curbing illegal immigration in the United States, and just as long as the new administration's focus remains on \"illegal,\" the Indian IT sector remains shielded. However, if unemployment continues to rise, as it has over the past few quarters, policy uncertainty risk becomes front and center.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"IT services could see an impact with U.S. being the dominant end market as well as potential changes to immigration, if any,\" said Citi economists Samiran Chakraborty and Baqar Zaidi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies such as Tata Consultancy Services , HCL Tech , and U.S.-listed Infosys are heavily reliant on work permits to bring employees from India into the U.S. However, over the years, the share of foreign workers employed at these companies has reportedly fallen to less than half, making them more resilient to changes in visa rules. Additionally, since the Covid-19 pandemic, most companies have trimmed their costs with remote working.\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy\n",
      "\n",
      "On the one hand, analysts expect Indian interests to be aligned with those of the United States regarding oil prices . Trump's previous term in office, whether intentionally or coincidently, saw moderate to low oil prices. Market observers expect that to be repeated in his second term.\n",
      "\n",
      "As India imports over 90% of its oil needs, New Delhi will likely welcome any move by the U.S. to keep oil prices low.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick resolution of the war in Ukraine — Trump's campaign promise — would also prove to be negative for oil prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, India is also hoping to become an exporter of renewable energy products and judging by the stock market's reaction to the news of the U.S. election results, that sector is unlikely to be in Trump's good books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mumbai-listed wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy 's shares tumbled after the U.S. election results. Although the company earns just 1.5% of its total revenue from the U.S., sales have grown by 42% over the past year, according to FactSet data. Will it continue to grow in the future?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kotak Institutional Equities' Sanjeev Prasad said the next U.S. administration's \"likely anti-ESG approach may not be positive for a portion of India's exports,\" such as solar panel module makers.\n",

      "Goldman Sachs has refreshed its list of top stock picks in Asia to include two automotive stocks: India's Mahindra and Mahindra and Japan's Honda Motor . The stocks are featured on the investment bank's \"Conviction List - Directors' Cut,\" which seeks to offer a \"curated and active\" list of buy-rated stocks. It comes as auto stocks have been in the spotlight in the region following stronger SUV sales in countries like India and high electric vehicle adoption in China . Mahindra and Mahindra Goldman is betting on Mahindra and Mahindra given its \"unique pipeline\" in India's SUV car market. \"M & M's evolution from a rural SUV brand in the previous decade to a lifestyle SUV brand in the current decade offers comfort on its upward trajectory in ASP (average selling price) and profit per unit dynamics,\" the investment bank wrote in a Nov. 3 note. Analyst Chandramouli Muthiah expects the company's \"strong new SUV order backlog and upcoming Battery Electric Vehicle launches to support industry leading growth visibility vs (its) peers.\" Mahindra plans to launch five new internal combustion engine SUVs and seven electric SUVs by 2030. Shares in Mahindra are listed on India's National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange and as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) in the U.S. under the MAHMF ticker. Its shares are up nearly 70% year-to-date. Goldman has a 12-month target price of 3,600 Indian rupees ($42.80) on the stock, implying 25% potential upside. Honda In Japan, Goldman is bullish on Honda which it describes as \"one of the few automakers that can maintain/expand its strong profit margins while making upfront investments in electrification and intelligent mobility.\" In analyst Kota Yuzawa's view, the stock stands to gain from \"growth in its motorcycle business, expanding earnings from next-generation hybrids, and appropriately controlling the timing of its investments.\" \"While some investors are concerned about a temporary decline in earnings as the company transitions to a higher EV sales weighting, we think hybrid earnings are likely to minimize this impact. At the same time, strong growth and profitability in its motorcycle division will help underpin earnings,\" he added. Shares in Honda trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and as an ADR in the U.S. under the HMC ticker. Its shares have been on a broad decline over the past 6 months, but remain up nearly 4% year-to-date. Goldman has a target price of 2,200 Japanese yen ($14.50) on the stock, implying 44.3% potential upside. The investment bank's stock picks are selected by a subcommittee in each region which \"collaborate with each sector analyst to identify top ideas that offer a combination of conviction, a differentiated view and high risk-adjusted returns,\" Goldman says. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "India is hungry for energy, and it's doing something about it. As the country's population grows — already the world's largest — and becomes wealthier, its energy demand is expected to rise. It's no wonder then that the South Asian nation aims to quadruple its natural gas use from the current level by 2030 to meet that demand and enable GDP growth rates of seven or eight percent annually. However, many readers might ponder why India is buying into an energy source that nearly brought Europe to its knees only a few years ago. The Russian invasion of Ukraine came alongside skyrocketing gas prices across Europe as Moscow turned off the taps and nearly held the continent's economy hostage. The nature of the gas market, then, meant buyers begged, bribed, or bullied sellers into supplying gas to keep their lights on. So why does India want to deepen its ties with such a volatile energy source? It might not have a choice and maintaining the status quo means rising energy security risks as its economy grows. Currently, more than 80% of India's energy needs are met by coal, oil and solid biomass, according to the International Energy Agency. Both coal and oil imports have risen rapidly as the population takes a liking to round-the-clock electricity and car ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oil accounted for more than 70% of imports in Russia, Iraq and Saudi Arabia — three countries that don't have strong democratic credentials. On the demand side, the Indian government has aggressively pushed policies that favor vehicles powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), a derivative of liquified natural gas (LNG).\n",
      "\n",
      "A man opens the hood of a Blue Energy 5528 liquefied natural gas (LNG) truck to check the engine at the manufacturing facility in Pune, India, October 11, 2024. Francis Mascarenhas | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "These vehicles have taken off faster than electric vehicles as a good distribution network for the fuel has lowered range anxiety. They're also typically cheaper to run on a per-mile basis. That's allowed sales to rise 33% this year to more than half a million vehicles, with Maruti Suzuki taking the lion's share of the market. Earlier this year, the government also unveiled plans to have a third of heavy-duty trucks in the country run on LNG instead of diesel, which currently makes up the bulk of refined fuel, over the next five to seven years. Aside from transport, LNG use has grown thanks to government policy encouraging natural gas for domestic cooking. Piped connections have grown 250% to 11.9 million over the seven years ending November 2023, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Meanwhile, the number of households that could receive piped natural gas is more than 300 million. India also appears to be happy to import LNG, even from unsavory partners, if it helps balance risks in other parts of its economy. For instance, natural gas is a crucial ingredient for making fertilizers, and manufacturing it domestically helps increase food security. Rystad Energy, a consultancy, has forecasted that the demand for natural gas will likely double by 2040. The research firm also expects India to be unable to meet its demand entirely through domestic sources and will have to rely \"heavily\" on imports to meet its needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As imports rise, this will likely benefit companies that are government-owned entities such as Petronet, which owns two LNG import terminals in the country, and gas distributor GAIL. Investment banks like Citi and JPMorgan and local brokers say a steady rise in volume growth without making gas more expensive for consumers will benefit both stocks. Indraprastha Gas (IGL), Mahanagar Gas (MGL) and Gujarat Gas are other distribution companies set to reap from the growing trend. \"We prefer PLNG to GAIL on a) lower valuations and b) the volatility in GAIL's gas trading segment,\" said JPMorgan analysts in a note to clients in June. Meanwhile, Citi analysts in August said, \"We continue with our preference for GAIL, MGL, and IGL among the gas stocks.\"\n",

      "Canada alleges Indian involvement in Sikh separatists plot. The Canadian government alleged this week that Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah is behind plots targeting Sikh separatists in Canada. The allegation was revealed by Canadian Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison, who told a parliamentary panel he had confirmed to a U.S.-based newspaper that it was Shah who is the accused behind the plots. India has previously dismissed the claims as baseless. India is confident it can hit its 7% growth target for its 2025 financial year. The country's Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs Ajay Seth said on Tuesday the goal is \"very much doable.\" Seth is also optimistic about India's growth rate for its third and fourth quarters despite slower capital expenditure in some states. India's fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31 the following year. The Reserve Bank of India lowered its forecast for India's second-quarter growth. Previous estimates by the RBI put GDP growth during India's fiscal second-quarter — which is from July to September — at 7.2%. However, the RBI reduced its forecast to 6.8%, attributing it to weakness in areas like Nifty earnings forecasts and goods and service tax collections.\n",

      "\n",
      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Interest in India has been picking up steadily among investors, thanks to its growing economy , strong stock market performance and burgeoning population . As the Diwali festive season gets underway in the South Asian powerhouse, several sectors — and stocks — are expected to do well, according to analysts at equity research firm Kotak Securities and asset management house Mirae Asset. Samvat 2081 — which starts on the day of Diwali on Oct. 31 — marks the start of the Hindu new year. Some investors view it as a new beginning for markets. The new year is commencing with most sectors — and stocks — being overvalued, according to Kotak's analysts. The rich market valuations, they added, make any market correction an opportunity to scoop up quality stocks with attractive valuations for the long term. Their comments come as Indian markets made history in Samvat 2080 — or last year — with the BSE Sensex surpassing 85,900 points in September while the benchmark Nifty 50 index crossed 26,250. Year-to-date, The BSE Sensex index — which represents 30 of the country's largest and most traded firms on the Bombay Stock Exchange — is up around 10.9% as of Oct. 30, while the benchmark Nifty 50 index is around 12.2% higher. Here are four buy-rated Indian stocks with over 30% potential upside that analysts are betting on this Diwali. Fiem Industries Fiem Industries is among Kotak Securities' top picks thanks to its debt-free balance sheet and robust cash flows. The manufacturer of automotive lighting and rear-view mirrors caters primarily to two-wheelers and has been \"outperforming,\" the industry, the analysts wrote in its initiation report on Sept. 3. They added that \"Fiem is well-placed to benefit from [a] two-wheeler industry recovery,\" which has picked up in the festive period, following sluggish sales between July and September. The company's growth is also supported by rising adoption of LED lighting in automotives, Kotak noted. Going forward, the analysts have penciled a 15% CAGR (compound average growth rate) for Fiem's revenue between full-year 2024 and full-year 2027, and 19% CAGR for its earnings. Shares of Fiem trade on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and are up nearly 45% year-to-date. Kotak has a 12-month target price of 2,140 Indian rupees ($25.45) on the stock, implying around 40.8% potential upside. Gravita India Material recycling company Gravita India was another stock on Kotak's list. The research house likes that Gravita's pan-India presence across 22 states \"provides sourcing benefits and fungibility.\" Other factors in its favor include regulatory tailwinds promoting recycling and the formalization of reverse charge mechanism on metal scrap, Kotak's analysts wrote in a Sept. 30 note. Looking ahead, they expect Gravita's earnings per share to grow 31.8% in full-year 2025 and 35.8% in 2026. The stock, which is up around 85.1% year-to-date, trades on India's NSE and BSE. It is also included in the iShares MSCI India Small Cap ETF (0.1% weighting). Kotak has a 12-month target price of 2,800 Indian rupees on the stock, implying a 38.2% potential upside. S H Kelkar and Company Also on Kotak's list is fragrance and flavors supplier S H Kelkar and Company . The research house describes the company as an \"emerging player\" that is \"well-placed to drive double-digit revenue growth.\" \"SHK['s] tiny relative to global majors, but its technical capabilities are reputable,\" Kotak's analysts wrote in their Sept. 30 re-initiation report. They pointed out SHK's \"reputable\" technical skills and the inroads in global markets as other merits. \"We see a long runway for growth, given its established and sticky relationships,\" the analysts added. Shares of SHK are listed on India's NSE and BSE and are up 103.3% this year. Kotak has a 12-month target price of 400 Indian rupees on the stock, or close to 35% potential upside. Gabriel India Meanwhile, asset manager Mirae Asset is betting on Gabriel India , an automotive parts manufacturer. The company — which is owned by automotive manufacturer Anand Group — is a market leader in the manufacture of ride control products such as suspension systems and shock absorbers. Mirae likes Gabriel's steady revenue visibility and \"increasing content per vehicle\" in the shock absorber segment driven by its launch of new products. Another plus is that it is a \"key beneficiary of increasing sunroof penetration in India led by premiumization trend and import substitute,\" the analysts added in a recent note on its Diwali picks. Shares of Gabriel India are listed on India's NSE and BSE and are up 13.4% this year. According to FactSet data, all eight analysts covering the stock have a \"buy\" rating at an average target price of 581.25 Indian rupees. This gives it 30.1% potential upside.\n",

Lipman is an author of seven books, including \"The New Rules of Aging Well,\" which he co-authored with Danielle Claro.

      "CNBC Make It: What are some of the things you do to keep your body healthy? I exercise, that includes strength training a few times a week, aerobic and intermittent high-intensity intervals a few times a week. I walk. I move as much as I can. I tend to go to sleep at the same time every night. I do some sort of meditation practice. [I] try to do it daily. What else do I do? And I take a sh-tload of supplements [including vitamin D and fish oil]. I do hormone replacement. I do many things to optimize my health, [I'm] very proactive about my health. Almost everything I recommend to my patients, I do myself. There is a lot conversation that focuses on brain health. Are there any things you do specifically to keep your brain healthy? I've had my brain mapped. And at least five or six times a week, I [use] a red light helmet at home. I put that on for at least 15 minutes to treat whatever we found on brain mapping. You can actually measure under active and over active areas in the brain and then target those areas with specific red light frequencies. So that's what I do. Apart from exercising, and trying to deal with my stress and sleep, I use a red light helmet. Having really important connections in your life is something that we hear when we talk about longevity. What's your social fitness like? My social fitness is very good. I'm quite obsessed with spending as much time as I can with my grandson. When he gets older, he's probably not going to want to spend as much time, so I'm taking advantage. He's soon to be five, but he's still at an age where he wants to be around his grandparents. We spend a lot of family time, and then we spend time with friends as well. What are some of the foods you really aim to get into your diet, either every day or every week? I tend to eat a low sugar, low carbohydrate, high protein diet. I'm a little bit obsessed with getting enough protein in my diet, so that's my focus. That can be eggs, red meat, chicken, fish. Then I eat a lot of green leafy vegetables, non-starchy vegetables. I love fruit, but I try not to eat too much of it. But I'll eat berries. So, I would say my diet is full of protein, fatty fish, non-starchy vegetables and berries. It's a Mediterranean diet without any bread or pasta. I usually do time-restricted eating, so I usually don't eat for a 16-hour period. I eat all of my food in an eight-hour period. What are you reading right now? Lately, [I've been] digging deeper into rapamycin. That's what I've been reading. Just exploring rapamycin.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump visits the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas, as seen from Piedras Negras, Mexico, February 29, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "President-Elect Donald J. Trump won the White House based partly on his promises to rein in immigration, with targeted policies that range from sending criminals to their home countries to more sweeping ones like mass deportations. During the campaign, Trump pledged to end the Temporary Protected Status that allows workers from select countries to come to the U.S. to work. If some of the larger deportation efforts, like rolling back TPS, come to fruition, experts say that there will be ripple effects felt in most sectors of the economy, in particular construction, housing and agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economists and labor specialists are most worried about the economic impact of policies that would deport workers already in the U.S., both documented and undocumented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staffing agencies were watching the election especially closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The morning after the election, we sat down as a leadership team and explored what does this mean for talent availability?\" said Jason Leverant, president and COO of the AtWork Group, a franchise-based national staffing agency. AtWork provides commercial staffing in immigrant-heavy verticals like warehouses, industrial, and agriculture in 39 states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workers – \"talent\" in industry parlance – are already in short supply. While the worst of the labor crisis spurred by the post-Covid economic boom has passed, and labor supply and demand has come back into balance in recent months, the number of workers available to fill jobs across the U.S. economy remains a closely watched data point. Mass deportation would exacerbate this economic issue, say employers and economists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the proposed immigration policies come into reality, there could be a significant impact,\" Leverant said, pointing to estimates that a mass deportation program could leave as many as one million difficult-to-fill potential job openings.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many undocumented immigrants work in the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are various statistics offered up about the undocumented immigrant population in the United States. The left-leaning Center for American Progress puts the number at around 11.3 million, with 7 million of them working. The American Immigration Council, an advocacy group in favor of expanding immigration, citing data from an American Community Survey, also puts the number of undocumented people in the United States around 11 million. The non-partisan Pew Research Center puts the number at closer to 8 million people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are millions, many millions who are undocumented who are in the trades; we don't have the Americans to do the work,\" said Chad Prinkey, the CEO of Well Built Construction Consulting, which works with construction companies. \"We need these workers; what we all want is for them to be documented; we want to know who they are, where they are, and make sure they are paying taxes; we don't want them gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leverant says it is still being determined how jobs lost from a mass deportation would be filled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do we pull talent from one area to another, but then someone else loses it,\" Leverant said. \"This is pretty significant and we have to stay ahead of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leverant says he is not concerned about losing any of the 20,000 workers AtWork sends to various places because document status is strenuously checked, but if other companies lose workers, they will be leaning even more heavily on staffing agencies like AtWork for talent that is already in short supply. And supply and demand dictate worker wages, which will be forced upwards. And that will ripple throughout the supply chain right into the supermarket or sporting goods store.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are playing the long game now, the pain will be felt and we will see shortages, and slow-downs and delays on every front,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Produce not making it to market because there are not enough workers to bring it to distribution, or delayed construction projects, are among likely outcomes from limited labor supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worries about workforce extend to skilled labor, tech\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also concerns about how stricter immigration policy could negatively impact skilled workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is more than low-skilled labor; this ripples into tech workers and engineers. We don't have enough skilled talent there either to fill the jobs,\" Leverant said, adding that he is not envisioning doctors and scientists being rounded up and deported, but restrictions on H-1B visas and a generally more unwelcoming atmosphere could deter talent from coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Janeesa Hollingshead, head of expansion at Uber Works, an on-demand staffing arm of the ride-share company, agrees tech will be impacted, if past is prologue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The tech industry relies heavily on immigrants to fill highly technical, crucial roles,\" Hollingshead said, recalling that Uber informed all tech workers on H-1B visas during Trump's first presidency that if they went to their home countries for holidays, they may not be able to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the American Immigration Council, during the first Trump administration, the government's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied a larger percentage of H-1B petitions than in the preceding four years, but many of the denials were overturned, leading to a lower level of denials by fiscal 2020, 13%, versus 24% in 2018. Fiscal years 2021and 2022 had the lowest denial rates ever recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hollingshead says that tech companies in the United States are going to be forced to find tech talent from currently overlooked pools of people already in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"U.S. companies are going to need to figure out how to do this or face an even more dire labor shortage,\" Hollingshead says.\n",
      "\n",
      "At his Madison Square Garden rally in New York right before the election, Trump said: \"On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would not write off his mass deportation process as rhetoric. We have to assume he means what he says,\" according to David Leopold, chair of the immigration practice group at law firm U.B. Greensfelder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, despite the impact that could churn through the labor market, in practice, the mass deportations might be difficult to pull off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very expensive to remove 11 million people,\" Leopold said, predicting that Trump will use ICE and federal agencies but also lean on local law enforcement to round up immigrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a phone interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker shortly after the election results, Trump invoked the darker rhetoric on migrants that proved successful during the campaign while saying he isn't opposed to people coming into the country — in fact, he said more people will be required if his administration's strategy of requiring businesses to set up operations within the U.S. is successful. \"We want people to come in,\" Trump said. \"We're gonna have a lot of businesses coming into our country. They want to come into our country. ... We want companies and factories and plants and automobile factories to come into our country, and they will be coming. And therefore we need people, but we want people that aren't necessarily sitting in a jail because they murdered seven people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Immigration Council estimates that in a longer-term mass deportation operation targeting one million people per year — which it said reflects \"more conservative proposals\" made by mass-deportation proponents — the cost would average out to $88 billion annually, for a total cost of $967.9 billion over the course of more than a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his interview with NBC News, Trump dismissed concerns about cost. \"It's not a question of a price tag,\" he said. \"We have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here. ... there is no price tag,\" Trump said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leopold says depending in the severity of the plan, changes could reach consumers in the form of increasing prices, supply problems, and restricted access to goods and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Construction and housing damage\n",
      "\n",
      "Nan Wu, research director of the American Immigration Council, echoes the concerns of others in predicting turmoil for consumers if deportations tick upward under Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mass deportation would exacerbate ongoing U.S. labor shortages, especially in industries that rely heavily on undocumented immigrant workers,\" Wu said, citing AIC's research that shows the construction industry would lose one in eight workers, citing AIC\"s research that 14 percent of construction workers in the United States are undocumented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The removal of so many workers within a short period would push up construction costs and lead to delays in building new homes, making housing even less affordable in many parts of the country,\" Wu said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same, she says, applies to the agriculture industry which would also see a loss of one in eight workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Looking at specific occupations, about one-quarter of farm workers, agricultural graders, and sorters are undocumented workers. Losing the agricultural workers who grow, pick, and pack our food would hurt domestic food production and raise food prices,\" Wu said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figures from the USDA put the number of undocumented farm workers at 41 percent in 2018, the most recent year figures are available, with California having the highest number.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AIC estimates that the U.S. GDP would shrink by $1.1 trillion to $1.7 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservative think tank American Compass argues for a \"skills-based immigration policy\" which it says would require \"serious immigration enforcement that prevents people from working illegally. Such enforcement will need to deal prospectively with the future flow of immigrants as well as grapple with the millions of illegal workers already here,\" it stated in a policy brief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among its policy priorities are mandatory use of the E-Verify system by all employers, along with severe criminal penalties for repeated or willful violations; short-term work permits available to illegal immigrants who have already been in the country for a significant period of time — but with establishment of a timeline for when they must leave the country based on how long they've already been residing in it; and for those who have resided in U.S. for the longest, the ability to obtain permanent legal status after paying a substantial fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prinkey says the impact of a mass deportation program would be dramatic. \"One of the natural problems with undocumented workers, we don't know how many are here because they are undocumented. It isn't straightforward. I would wager that half or more of on-site labor is undocumented in specific geographic regions,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you are building a nuclear facility or colleges and universities, you might be working with very few undocumented workers because there is a much higher level of oversight,\" Prinkey said. \"Those are sectors that will shrug and go forward.\" He expected the same for union workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there will be big impacts on single-family and multi-family housing construction, according to Prinkey, sectors of the housing market which he thinks could be \"paralyzed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There will be incredible delays; the average 18-month project could take five years to complete because there are so few bodies,\" Prinkey said. \"It will be less devastating in Boston than Austin; in Austin, it would shut down every project,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the dire forecast, Prinkey doesn't think mass deportation will come to pass. \"Donald Trump is a developer; he understands what is going on. A mass deportation is not possible without crippling economic impact,\" he said.\n",

      "Chinese authorities last month announced high-level plans for subsidies and tax breaks to households with children under the age of 3. The measures also extended maternity leave to 158 days from 98 days. Last year, the country doubled childcare tax breaks to 2,000 yuan ($280) per month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than trying to induce a sizeable \"birth spurt,\" China's policies so far have been more about \"supporting families [and] allowing those who do want to have a second or third child to do this with more ease and affordability,\" said Lauren Johnston, associate professor of China Studies Center at the University of Sydney.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of new marriage registrations also plunged by 25% year on year in the third quarter, indicating the total for the year will drop to 6.4 million, the lowest since 1979, according to financial services firm Nomura's analysis of official data released this month .\n",
      "\n",
      "China's efforts to bolster birth rates have yet to address the core reasons for their rapid decline, according to analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Births in China have been on a drastic downward trend since the government implemented its \"one-child policy\" nationwide in 1980. The United Nations in July forecast that China, the second most-populous country in the world, will likely lose more than half of its population by 2100 in the greatest drop of any country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"mental hangover\" from the one-child policy has lingered and \"fundamentally changed young people's perception of families,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, economist at Moody's Analytics. He added that slower economic growth has also led \"young people to second-guess or delay plans to start a family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is an incredibly difficult task [and] there is no silver bullet to lifting fertility rates,\" said Cruise.\n",
      "\n",
      "World Bank data showed that the fertility rate, defined as births per woman, was 1.2 in China in 2022, below 1.7 in the U.S., which has benefited from a more open immigration policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's share of the world's live births is expected to drop to around 3% in 2100 from 8% in 2021, according to Austin Schumacher, an assistant professor of health metrics sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Current studies on various pro-natal policies have only shown modest increases which our projections show will not be sufficient to reverse population decline,\" Schumacher said. \"However, with new innovations and research into improving current endeavors and developing new one, it could be possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An increasingly pressing factor for families in China is uncertainty about income for raising a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "After decades of rapid expansion, China's economy has slowed down, dragged down by a real estate slump. Crackdowns on after-school tutoring, gaming, finance and internet platform companies have also hit hiring in industries that were once popular with recent graduates.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's youth unemployment rate — measured by those aged 16 to 24 and not in school— rose to a record high of 18.8% in August. It edged lower in September.\n",

      "\"The problem really is that people don't have the confidence to make ends meet for themselves, let alone think about having enough to raise children,\" said Sheana Yue, economist at Oxford Economics.\n",

      "MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA - 2024/10/21: Hyundai logo is seen on the Hyundai car showroom in Mumbai. Hyundai Initial Public Offer (IPO) will be listed on the stock exchange on 22nd October 2024. (Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n",

      "This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyundai became India's second-largest automaker by demonstrating that it understands the market by tailoring its globally popular and technologically advanced cars not only to Indian consumers' tastes but also to its roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Korean car giant, the world's third-largest passenger vehicle maker by volume, set up shop in India in 1996, soon after the country's reforms to liberalize its socialist economy. Fast forward 28 years, and the company appears to have bagged its biggest payday yet by raising $3.3 billion from the stock market by offloading a 17.5% stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock has pared back losses since, but is still 5% below its initial public offering price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares of carmaker Hyundai 's Indian subsidiary started trading this week with much anticipation, only to drop by some 7% on its debut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite such success, it appears as if the stock market has given Hyundai the cold shoulder this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares have fallen across the board with the Nifty 50 index declining by about 5% over the past month. However, investors have pointed to several elements of the listing that might have also contributed to the immediate downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the money raised by the stock market listing is being fed back to Hyundai's Korean parent. In a typical IPO, however, money raised is used to invest in growth or pay down debt. Investors have balked at the idea that the Indian subsidiary won't necessarily benefit from the cash raised on the stock market, nor has the Korean parent made it clear how it intends to use the proceeds of the share sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it appears as if Hyundai doesn't have an immediate need for the raised capital, and it's merely being opportunistic by taking advantage of what some have called \"frothy\" markets in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not that the company needed money, so it's really the parent trying to take advantage of the valuation,\" said Gaurav Narain, principal advisor at the India Capital Growth Fund , which is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The ICG fund primarily invests in Indian small and mid-cap stocks and did not participate in the IPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kunjal Gala, head of global emerging markets and lead portfolio manager of the $3.3 billion Federated Hermes Global Emerging Markets Equity Fund, speculated the decision to list the Indian subsidiary could have been born out of a need for \"a better valuation for their parent company in Korea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gala's fund holds stakes in other automakers such as Maruti Suzuki , India's largest automaker, and China's BYD . \"So, this is one way of financially engineering a better valuation, right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the listing, the Indian subsidiary now commands nearly half the market capitalization of its Korean parent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyundai has also appeared to make up for any loss of future income from its share sale by hiking the royalty fees it charges its Indian subsidiary. Royalty fees were, until June, negotiated between the Indian entity and the Korean parent on a per-model basis. However, the Indian subsidiary must now pay a flat 3.5% of total revenue going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equity analysts at financial services company Emkay initiated stock coverage with a \"sell\" rating, citing reduced earnings potential thanks to the higher royalty payment, saying, \"higher royalty, and lower treasury income are likely to restrict [earnings per share] growth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If that wasn't sufficient, a number of investors and analysts suggest Hyundai priced the stock with minimal upside for a blockbuster IPO listing, a big turn-off for most retail investors. \"What the retail investor wants is a big discount,\" Narain added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others have, however, argued that investors sitting on the sidelines of one of India's premier automakers are losing out on long-term gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We believe [Hyundai Motor India] is a good proxy to play the rising premiumisation trend in the Indian car industry,\" said Nomura's analyst Kapil Singh in a note to clients on Oct. 22.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More importantly, customers are increasingly becoming aspirational and willing to pay more for attractive designs and high-tech features.\" Singh expects the stock to rise by about 32% from Thursday's close to 2,472 Indian rupees ($29.40).\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts at Macquarie also agree that Hyundai is best placed to capture the changing face of India's middle class and rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investment bank also suggested that Hyundai India, thanks to its parent's expertise and success in developing state-of-the-art hybrid and electric vehicles for Korean and Western markets, will be best placed to offer Indian consumers a superior product compared to its competitors when the time is right for the EV transition in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We believe its strong parent [company] prepares it well to address India's evolving powertrain mix better than domestic peers,\" said Macquarie's analysts Ashish Jain and Pratik, who initiated coverage of the stock with an \"Outperform\" rating and a price target of 2,235 rupees, pointing to about 20% upside.\n",

      "Top 10 things to watch Thursday, Oct. 24 CNBC's Matthew J. Belvedere with the help of Jeff Marks wrote this dispatch. 1. The S & P 500 was trying to break a three-session losing streak. Stocks were given some relief from lower bond yields, which have been recently rising despite the Fed's monetary easing. Bond traders have been pushing yields up, signaling central bankers were too heavy-handed with September's jumbo half-point interest rate cut. 2. Tesla shares were jumping 14.5% and leading the Nasdaq toward a higher open after the EV maker beat on quarterly earnings per share (EPS). While missing on revenue, Elon Musk's prediction of 20% to 30% \"vehicle growth\" next year sparked investor buying. He cited \"lower cost vehicles\" and the \"advent of autonomy.\" 3. Club industrial stocks Honeywell and Dover were dropping after issuing quarterly results. Honeywell raised the low-end of full-year earnings guidance but lowered its sale outlook. Dover's guidance was messy due to updates to reflect discontinued operations and divestitures. 4. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that longtime Taiwanese manufacturing partner TSMC helped fix a design flaw that \"caused the yield to be low\" in its next-gen Blackwell AI chips. The hiccup had hindered production. Holding an AI summit in India, Nvidia said it will supply AI chips to Indian companies. 5. Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research beat on quarterly earnings and revenue and its stock jumped 5%. The results were in contrast to peer ASML's weakness that brought down the whole sector last week before TSMC's strong results provided a boost. 6. Oppenheimer raised its Salesforce price target to $330 per share from $300 and kept its outperform buy rating. The analysts cited their survey about the technology priorities of 33 Salesforce customers. The results were mixed, they said, but pointed to industry and macro forces that should help Club name Salesforce down the line. 7. Boeing machinists rejected a new labor contract that included wage increases of 35% over four years. The walkout has been going on for more than five weeks and has halted more of Boeing aircraft production. 8. Southwest Airlines and Elliott Investment Management announced a settlement deal to avoid a boardroom battle. In exchange, the activist investor group got more director seats and accelerated the retirement of executive chairman Gary Kelly. The agreement, however, does keep CEO Bob Jordan on the job. Southwest also reported quarterly beats on EPS and revenue. 9. Shares of United Parcel Service soared 8.5% after the company reported third-quarter beats on earnings and revenue. U.S. package delivery revenue topped estimates. International as well as supply chain and freight segments matched expectations. 10. T-Mobile reported third-quarter core adjusted EBITDA of $8.24 billion, which beat estimates. So did EPS and revenue. Total wireless net additions exceeded expectations as well. The company raised postpaid net customer additions guidance for the full year. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

      "Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed on Wednesday to boost communication and cooperation between their countries and resolve conflicts to help improve ties that were damaged by a deadly military clash in 2020. The two leaders met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia for their first formal talks in five years, signaling that ties between the Asian giants have begun to recover from the diplomatic rift caused by the clash along their disputed Himalayan frontier. India and China, two of the world's biggest economies, have maintained strong trade ties despite the military and diplomatic tensions. The rapprochement is expected to boost Chinese investment in India. India said the two leaders have directed their officials to take further steps to stabilize all aspects of bilateral ties. The Xi-Modi meeting in the city of Kazan came two days after New Delhi said it had reached a deal with Beijing to resolve the four-year military stand-off in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, although neither side has shared details of the pact.\n",

      "The two sides should strengthen communication and cooperation, resolve conflicts and differences, and realize each other's development dreams, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported Xi as telling Modi. Modi put forward ideas for improving and developing bilateral relations, to which Xi agreed in principle, CCTV added without elaborating. In response, Modi told Xi that peace, stability, mutual trust and respect were crucial for relations. \"We welcome the agreement on the issues that had come up over the last four years,\" Modi told Xi in comments aired on India's state broadcaster Doordarshan. \"It should be our priority to maintain peace and tranquility on the border. Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity should be the basis of our relationship,\" Modi said. Relations between the world's two most populous nations — both nuclear powers — have been strained since a clash between their troops on the largely un-demarcated frontier in the western Himalayas left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead in 2020. The neighbors have added tens of thousands of troops and weapons along the icy frontier over the last four years. Modi and Xi had not held formal bilateral talks since then, although both participated in multilateral events. Their last bilateral summit talks were held in October 2019 in the southern Indian town of Mamallapuram. The two spoke briefly on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali in November 2022. They spoke again on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Johannesburg in August 2023 but released different versions of the conversation, suggesting they didn't see eye to eye. Xi skipped the G20 summit hosted by New Delhi the following month, a decision seen as another setback to relations. Diplomatic efforts gained momentum in recent months after the two countries' foreign ministers met in July and agreed to step up talks to ease the border tensions.\n",

      "Russia is rolling out the red carpet to its geopolitical allies as it hosts the latest BRICS summit on Tuesday, pushing its agenda to create a \"new world order\" that challenges the West. The group was initially comprised of Brazil, Russia, India and China before South Africa joined in 2010, giving the organization of rapidly economically-developing nations its current name. It has since morphed into a geopolitical forum for the world's most powerful nations outside of the West. The BRICS now have additional clout after Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates joined the group in January, with membership to the bloc becoming an attractive prospect for countries looking to boost trade, investment and economic development. Russia has been trying to woo what's collectively known as the \"Global South\" — or economically-developing countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America — and contrast to the \"Global North\" of industrialized nations, traditionally led by the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently comments on his ambition to establish what he calls a \"new world order\" to rival and usurp the geopolitical and economic pre-eminence enjoyed by the U.S.-led West. Russia, holder of the rotating BRICS presidency and economically isolated and heavily sanctioned by the West, can also turn to this year's summit to demonstrate that it still commands respect on the global stage and has powerful allies willing to turn a blind eye to its ongoing war in Ukraine.\n",

      "\n",
      "Putin has described the beefed-up BRICS group as a \"strong indication of the growing authority of the association and its role in international affairs\" and signaled on Friday that he intends for the so-called \"BRICS +\" format to challenge the West on both a geopolitical and economic front. \"The countries in our association are essentially the drivers of global economic growth. In the foreseeable future, BRICS will generate the main increase in global GDP,\" Putin told officials and businessmen last Friday at the BRICS business forum in Moscow, which precedes the group's summit, in comments translated by Reuters. \"The economic growth of BRICS members will increasingly depend less on external influence or interference. This is essentially economic sovereignty,\" Putin added. Earlier in October, Putin said Moscow was open to using the summit for discussions with its allies on the \"the parameters of interaction in the emerging multipolar world, and is open to discussing the issues of building a new world order with all our friends, partners and like-minded people,\" he said, according to Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Putin added that \"it is in this spirit that we are preparing the BRICS and Outreach/BRICS Plus summit,\" referring to the last day of the three-day summit when officials from almost 40 Asian, African, Middle Eastern and Latin American countries are attending as part of the group's bid to expand ties with the \"Global South.\"\n",

      "The expansion of the BRICS coalition is both significant and performative, one security analyst told CNBC. \"It is indicative of a collective movement away from the West, a demonstration of a fundamental shift within the world order that is seeking to challenge Western economic hegemony,\" Callum Fraser, a research fellow in Russian and Eurasian security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, told CNBC Monday. Fraser added that it was \"still unclear to what degree BRICS+ will be able to challenge the Western-dominated G7, or even to what degree they are able to align their visions of the international system.\" \"Currently, the main glue that holds them together is the aspiration to achieve the same quality of life as in the West that they feel unable to achieve through cooperation with the West. Ultimately, BRICS+ is only anti-West in that it operates as an alternative institution. This means that it still remains to be seen what BRICS+ will provide for its member states, but increased cooperation among its members is extremely likely,\" he said. Russia's chairing of the summit would be \"utilized to maximum effect to demonstrate Russia's strong position within this emerging order,\" Fraser added.\n",

It's unclear whether the elephant in the room — Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine — will be acknowledged at the summit. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Izvestia newspaper that the conflict in Ukraine was not on the agenda, but he insisted that participants could \"raise this issue at their discretion,\" according to a Google translation.\n",

      "\n",
      "India and China have reached a deal on patrolling their disputed frontier to end a four-year military stand-off, the Indian foreign minister said on Monday, paving the way for improved political and business ties between the Asian giants. The news came on the eve of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia for an Oct. 22-24 summit of the BRICS regional grouping, during which he could hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian officials said. Relations between the world's two most populous nations — both nuclear powers — have been strained since clashes between their troops on the largely un-demarcated frontier in the western Himalayas left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead in 2020. The two sides had since stopped patrolling several points along the border in the Ladakh region to avoid new confrontations, while moving tens of thousands of new troops and military equipment closer to the freezing highlands. \"We reached an agreement on patrolling, and with that we have gone back to where the situation was in 2020 and we can say... the disengagement process with China has been completed,\" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said at a NDTV media conclave.\n",
      "\n",
      "watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"understanding was reached only today,\" he said, adding: \"We always said that if you disturb the peace and tranquility how can the rest of the relationship go forward?\" To avoid clashes, the two militaries will patrol contested points along the border according to an agreed schedule, a senior Indian military officer aware of the details told Reuters. Both sides will monitor the area in Ladakh to ensure that there are no violations, the officer added. Authorities in Beijing offered no immediate response to India's remarks. Officials in New Delhi said the pact clears the path for a likely bilateral meeting between Modi and Xi on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, which will be their first since 2020. The senior military officer said that both sides would pull back their troops a little from current positions to avoid face-offs, but would be allowed to patrol these areas according to a schedule that is being worked out. Monthly review meetings and regular monitoring of the contested areas by both sides would ensure there are no violations, he added. Deependra Singh Hooda, a retired senior Indian army officer who was a commander for a part of the China frontier, said that while the two sides would need fresh confidence-building measures, \"at least the impasse has been broken\".\n",

      "\n",
      "India is mourning the death of Ratan Tata, the visionary industrialist and philanthropist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former chairman of the Tata Group is known for bringing the storied salt-to-software conglomerate to the global stage via a string of high-profile acquisitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "His strong business acumen led him to become one of India's wealthiest tycoons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The billionaire placed 421 in the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022, based on his net worth of approximately 38 billion Indian rupees ($452 million). Another list by Fortune India-Waterfield captured his net worth as 160.4 billion Indian rupees, a figure that includes his stakes in Tata Sons, Tata Steel , Tata Consultancy Services , Tata Motors and Titan Company .\n",
      "\n",
      "Ratan Tata — along with the Ambani and Adani families — have become household names given their wealth and influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are, however, becoming less representative of the South Asian powerhouse's growing super-rich population.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new rich populace\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The previous school of thought was that rich people were just the Tatas, Birlas or the Ambanis. But, that's changing today — the rich are not just leaders of traditional business conglomerates,\" Himanshu Kohli, the co-founder of Indian multi-family office and private wealth manager Client Associates, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to CNBC's Inside India, Kohli noted that India's wealthy now come from a swathe of industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lots of money has been created, whether it is in the sports arena, movies, among celebrities, investment bankers or private equity professionals,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professionals, who have \"created substantial value\" in their jobs or organizations, are now also making the cut, Kohli noted. These individuals — who are often in the C-suite bracket — can \"create $50 to $200 million in wealth over a lifetime,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another group of individuals attaining the rich status are \"owners of listed companies who have sold part of their shares into the stock market rally, owners of hitherto unlisted businesses who have sold shares in their IPOs and startup founders who have sold their businesses, or shares to multinationals or bigger companies,\" said Pramod Gubbi, co-founder of Marcellus Investment Managers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comments come as more Indians choose to set up their own company instead of working for an organization. Data from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore revealed that the number of startups in India rose 71.5% from around 20,000 in 2021, to over 34,000 in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many Indian startups capitalized on the private equity boom by selling shares in 2022, prior to the funding winter. Others are now riding on India's IPO boom to cash out of their startups in the hope of making gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before the funding winter hit, a lot of startup founders created wealth by selling off their shares. That's given them a lump sum to invest and become active investors in financial markets. Others are listing now and getting substantial gains. Both moves are giving founders lots of wealth,\" Gubbi told CNBC's Inside India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere, the investment manager also observed that individuals across ages and professions have benefitted from the stock market rallies in India over the last three to four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "India's stock market became the fourth-largest in the world at the start of the year, after overtaking Hong Kong. Since then, markets have been making steady gains with the BSE Sensex index — which represents 30 of the country's largest and most traded firms on the Bombay Stock Exchange — up around 12% year-to-date, while the benchmark Nifty 50 index is around 13.8% higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is 'rich'?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no fixed definition of \"rich\" used by wealth managers. However, a widely accepted threshold for individuals in the high-net-worth bracket is 50–250 million Indian rupees. Individuals with wealth exceeding 250 million Indian rupees fall under the ultra-high-net-worth category, Kohli said. Meanwhile, those whose wealth falls between 10 to 50 million Indian rupees are in the affluent category, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "India's ultra-wealthy population — people with a net worth of at least $30 million — rose to 13,263 in 2023, a 6.1% increase from the prior year, according to Knight Frank. This number is expected to surge 50.1% between 2023 and 2028, the fastest growth rate for UHNWIs in the world, the same report stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kohli estimates that the UHNWI population is growing at 10% per annum while that of the HNWIs is 16%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This means that every few minutes 1 HNWI with a projected wealth of $1 million is born while 3 UHNWIs with upwards of $30 million is born in India every day. That's the tailwinds happening in our society today,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's also interesting is the shift in age profile of these individuals. Historically, India's wealthy had a median age exceeding 50. Today, however, seeing millionaires aged 30 or 40 is not uncommon, said Marcellus' Gubbi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another trend, he adds, is that they do not necessarily live in the nation's metropolises. \"The bulk of the accumulation of wealth has happened in bigger cities. Having said that, I think the wealth management industry is also penetrating into tier two and tier three cities,\" Gubbi said. Examples of these cities include Pune, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the city centers, he sees the wealthy coming up in industrial areas such as in the outskirts of Chennai, which are \"getting prosperous, particularly with the growth in manufacturing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Drivers of India's wealth\n",
      "\n",
      "The growth in India's wealthy population comes in tandem with the nation's economic progress. The South Asian giant is slated to become the world's third-largest economy by 2027, assuming its current growth trajectory continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"India's economy is doing well, its stock market is doing well and it is the only other economy after the U.S. to have created wealth in the stock market consistently over the last 30 years since its liberalization,\" Gubbi said. The nation's prosperity, he added, has benefitted both businesses and individuals by enabling \"stronger wealth accumulation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor fueling the rise in India's wealthy is a shift from physical assets, such as gold and land, to financial assets like stocks, mutual funds and alternatives, the investment manager observed. The move was driven in large part by a pullback in money generated predominantly through tax evasions and unaccounted transactions in real estate, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that the move to financial assets brought on \"an exponential\" growth in wealth as it yielded higher returns, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implications of a wealthy populace\n",
      "\n",
      "The legions of the wealthy in India are consequential to the nation's growth story. Their outsized influence relative to their population size on consumption patterns and investment behavior is reflective of India's economic story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think a lot of UHNWIs and HNWIs want to use their money to invest in themselves and the future generations by spending on better quality products and services,\" said Malcolm Dorson, a senior portfolio manager at Global X ETFs. Global X's parent, Mirae Asset, is one of the largest foreign asset managers in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, he expects a myriad of sectors ranging from wealth management to autos, health care, real estate and education to benefit from this premiumization wave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're seeing a lot of the UHNWI and HNWIs investing in things like luxury vehicles from say Mercedes and Volvo to good quality jewelry from Titan and better health care at private hospitals like Apollo Hospitals . And so, that's where the opportunities for growth lie in India as more people become affluent,\" Dorson added.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hyundai Motor India sold shares worth $989.4 million to institutional investors including BlackRock and Fidelity on Monday, as the carmaker launched a $3.3 billion IPO that will be the country's largest share offering yet. The Government of Singapore and BlackRock together picked up stakes worth a total of $77.3 million, while Fidelity bought shares worth $76.5 million. Domestic mutual funds were allocated shares worth a total $340 million. The IPO shows continued enthusiasm for India's capital markets, with 260 companies having raised more than $9 billion so far in 2024, according to LSEG data. The year-to-date volume has already surpassed the $7.42 billion total raised last year. Hyundai will not issue new shares in the IPO, in which its South Korean parent will sell up to 17.5% of its stake in the wholly-owned unit that will be valued at up to $19 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "At that size, Hyundai India will make up about 40% of its parent company Hyundai Motor's market capitalization. According to official filings, 142,194,700 shares are on offer in a price band of 1,865 to 1,960 rupees, and the deal is the first time Hyundai is listed outside of its South Korean home market. Retail and other investors can place orders from Tuesday to Thursday following on from Monday's buying by the anchor investors — large institutions that usually buy shares at the upper end of the price band and are subject to a lock-in period when they cannot sell shares. The stock will begin trading in Mumbai on Oct. 22. Hyundai India's IPO is set to eclipse the country's previous record of Life Insurance Corporation of India's 2022 deal when it raised $2.5 billion. Globally, it will be the second largest IPO this year in terms of money raised, following Lineage Inc's $5.1 billion U.S. IPO in July. With its SUV-focused portfolio, the company is seeking to capitalize on consumer preferences for bigger vehicles and safety, analysts at IDBI Capital said, adding this should help Hyundai India gain market share and grow ahead of the industry.\n",

      "### TEXT: \n",
      "A Russian-chartered oil tanker in the sea off Morocco in an area identified by maritime technology company Windward as a hub for smuggling oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A cap enforcement crackdown runs the risk of driving up crude prices,\" he said. \"Plus, using 'secondary' sanctions to enforce the cap could push reputable insurers out of the Russian crude game entirely, leaving the market to potentially insolvent stand-ins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kevin Book, managing director of research at Clearview Energy Partners, told CNBC that despite the G-7's June and September calls for improving the price cap, and recent guidance urging parties to Russian petroleum transactions to better scrutinize cargoes, \"a U.S. pinch on Russian petroleum seems unlikely until after the election.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent report to clients, Clearview Energy Partners characterized the G-7 price cap on Russian petroleum exports to third countries as \"increasingly loose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukraine allies, including the U.S., have banned the import of Russian crude, while a price cap imposed on Russian oil by the G7 countries, the European Union and Australia bans the use of Western maritime services such as insurance, flagging and transportation when tankers carry Russian oil priced at or above $60 a barrel to nations where a ban is not enforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Clearview Energy Partners, Russian crude prices over the last four weeks have averaged about six cents below the Brent crude price. That is far off the trading discount when the cap was first put in place. When the cap was fully phased in, in February 2023, Russian crude was selling at a 30% discount. A year ago, the discount was about 16%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent data shows the discount on Russian oil narrowing and exports increasing despite the G-7 price cap on Russian petroleum exports and U.S. sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book explained that part of the narrowing of the discount is a result of Russian oil finding additional buyers, including India and China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Record volumes of sanctioned Russian oil were carried by the \"dark fleet\" and known sanctioned tankers without known insurance over September, according to a recent report from Lloyd's List.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lloyd's List Intelligence unit analysis of data from energy cargo tracking firm Vortexa revealed that 69% of all crude shipped in September was carried on dark fleet tankers and 18% was carried on tankers owned by Russian government-controlled Sovcomflot. It is the most volume moved since tracking of the monthly dark fleet data began in mid-2022 (measured by deadweight capacity of vessels.) In May, 54% was recorded, the previous high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese and Indian oil traders, refiners, and port authorities were the drivers of this growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd's List determines if a tanker is part of the dark fleet based on factors including if the ship is 15 years or older, is anonymously owned or has a corporate structure designed to conceal ownership, is handling sanctioned oil trade, and is using deceptive shipping practices. Its analysis showed a flurry of flag-hopping, where a vessel changes its country registration, as well as ownership and management changes amongst the vessels in the dark fleet to avoid detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark fleet data does not include Russia's Sovcomflot or Iran's National Iranian Tanker Co.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its data revealed that 5% of all Russian oil in September was transported by 11 tankers, with nine of those vessels sanctioned by the UK or EU between July and September and owned by the Russian government-controlled tanker company Sovcomflot. The remaining vessels were sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control for breaching sanctions on Syrian and Iranian oil. Those vessels are the Eternal Peace and Nebulax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the Sovcomflot tankers that Lloyd's List identified in its report were sanctioned by the UK or EU between July and September. Some tankers changed vessel names, reflagged the vessel's origin to Barbados, or redomiciled registered ownership to Seychelles and changed their ship management to a newly incorporated UAE-based ship manager, Avebury Shipmanagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece-owned tankers have shipped 23% of oil from Russia in September, consistently over the last three months, according to Lloyd's List. The majority of the UK- and EU-sanctioned tankers have already discharged their oil in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said despite the price cap, some ship owners have decided that it was extremely profitable to have their vessels become part of the dark fleet and risk United States and EU sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all, Russian oil continues to be purchased by Chinese and Indian refiners with little repercussions from the U.S. or EU,\" said Lipow.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told CNBC, \"Two years since the price cap was implemented, it is unsurprising that Putin is still sinking money into building and maintaining a shadow fleet to escape the Coalition's sanctions: that evasion costs the Kremlin, and diverts money that would otherwise be going to the battlefield. The Price Cap Coalition continues to engage with industry to ensure compliance with the price cap and to increase Putin's costs of going outside it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of uninsured vessels carrying sanctioned oil also increased, according to Lloyd's List, with some 201 of the 310 tankers tracked not having insurance with the 12 clubs that form the International Group of P&I Clubs. That represented 68% of the vessels when measured by deadweight, and the lowest number of tankers tracked with IG club insurance, surpassing 67% uninsured recorded in July and August.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lipow said the oil market is pricing in a greater probability of a war between Iran and Israel that could impact supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The biggest risk to the oil market is the closure of the Straits of Hormuz, and while unlikely, if it were to happen, oil prices would rise $30 per barrel,\" he said. Despite the hostilities, oil prices remain under pressure, he said, as increased production from the U.S., Canada and Guyana adds to the supply picture while OPEC+ delays the restoration of its production cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The increased use of dark fleet vessels comes with greater maritime safety and environmental risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd's List warned in a recent note that shipping safety has become a \"casualty of economic sanctions\" with attempts to enhance sanctions policy leading to greater ranks of tankers determined to evade it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insurance giant Allianz said in May that dark fleet tankers had been linked to more than 50 accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lipow told CNBC if these vessels were to be involved in an accident that resulted in an oil spill, the owners — assuming they could be identified and found — would simply walk away, leaving the mess and subsequently the cleanup for someone else to do.\n",

      "Shares of Vestas Wind Systems tanked on the news that Donald Trump had won the 2024 presidential election. Investors dumped shares of the world's largest wind turbine maker as Trump has vowed to curtail renewable energy subsidies and favors the oil and gas sector. Other European renewable energy firms, such as wind farm operator Orsted , also fell. However, analysts at a number of investment banks have suggested that investors overreacted to fears of a downturn for the sector. VWDRY 1Y line \"Donald Trump's victory and a republican sweep in Congress is the worst political outcome in the USA for Vestas,\" said Jacob Pedersen, head of stock analysis at Sydbank, a Danish investment bank. \"But this does not necessarily convert into the worst legislation-scenario or the very negative earnings-scenario that the Vestas share reflects right now.\" Pedersen said that any change to the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature policy that offers billions in subsidies for clean energy companies, would not lower revenues for Vestas as it has sufficient orders in the pipeline in the U.S. over the next two years. \"Furthermore, is it likely that fear of changes in legislation can bring forward customers plans and bring new orders forward so Vestas can build an order pipeline through 2026 and into 2027 before we know more about Donald Trump's intentions for change of the IRA,\" Pedersen added in a note to clients on Nov. 5. \"We maintain the Buy recommendation on Vestas.\" And he's not alone — the consensus price target of all analysts covering the stock points to an upside of more than 50%. CEO loads up One investor appearing to heed the analysts' call is the company's CEO. Vestas disclosed on Nov. 6 that chief executive Henrik Andersen had purchased 10,000 shares amounting to about $150,000 on the Nasdaq Copenhagen exchange. Vestas shares are also traded in the U.S. with the ticker VWDRY . Deutsche Bank's analysts John Kim and Gael de-Bray agree that the political sentiment in the United States is \"not supportive\" of Vestas' share price, but suggest that the market's overreaction may have priced in too much of the worst-case scenario. This could offer investors an opportunity, according to the analysts, as shares could rally if the situation is better than forecast. \"We find limited downside from current levels but the shares may not perform short-term due to uncertainty,\" they added. In addition to the political headwinds, Vestas Wind Systems has also had to contend with the rising cost of materials and labor over the past few quarters. That's led to declining margin profits, adding pressure on the stock, which has fallen by more than 50% this year. However, analysts say that costs have stabilized, and the company's margins are turning around. Adjusting for this, Deutsche Bank lowered its price target on the stock to 150 Danish kroner ($21.56), which still implies a 40% upside from current levels.\n",

      "Investment bank Nomura has screened for Japanese stocks with \"high bitcoin price sensitivity,\" following a surge in the cryptocurrency's price. The bank noted that \"stocks of exchange operators plus semiconductor, IT, and nonferrous names track BTC but are currently lagging.\" It comes as analysts say bitcoin prices could hit $100,000 by the end of the year following President-elect Donald Trump's victory . Year-to-date, the price of bitcoin was up 72.8% to trade around $76,111 on Nov. 8. BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin Trump promised several pro-cryptocurrency initiatives as he campaigned for a second term as president. His \"call for the loosening of regulations on crypto assets naturally has an influence on the price of bitcoin,\" Nomura's analysts noted. The bank said it conducted multiple regression analyses of stocks to identify which have a high bitcoin price sensitivity. It gave each stock a sensitivity of at least 0.1, with a higher number implying it is more sensitive to changes in the price of bitcoin. The stocks come from a range of sectors and \"do not necessarily have any direct connection with bitcoin,\" the analysts explained, with some from \"adjacent industries\" such as semiconductors — which is seeing increased demand as a result of bitcoin mining — and IT. Here are 10 stocks from the investment bank's screen that stand out for having substantial upside potential, according to FactSet's consensus price targets: Top stocks Among the names on the bank's screen are semiconductor equipment manufacturers Micronics Japan and Towa Corporation . According to FactSet, analysts are mostly bullish on both companies. Those covering Micronics give it an average price target of 7,033.33 Japanese yen ($46.05) — indicating almost 83% upside potential. Analysts give Towa Corp an average target price of 3,466.67 Japanese yen, or 67.5% upside potential, according to FactSet. Elsewhere, investment management giant SoftBank Group also turned up on the screen given its focus on — and significant investment in — artificial intelligence. Sixteen of 20 analysts covering the stock give it a buy or overweight rating, according to FactSet, with an average target price of 11,931.20 Japanese yen, implying 29.4% upside potential. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Some stocks may be poised for more upside after President-elect Donald Trump's White House victory. Since Trump's win, the market has already seen some major gains. In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S & P 500 posted all-time intraday highs during Friday's trading session, with the blue-chip index topping 44,000 and the broad market index hitting 6,000 for the first time. Stocks in various sectors considered to be beneficiaries also saw gains in the wake of the election, with key names ranging from those in industrials to banks and energy. Those sectors in particular had several winners in the rally following Trump's 2016 win , and analysts believe gains may likewise be in store this time around – especially for energy. \"Based on different approaches to the Energy Transition (ET), we believe a Trump admin would be more favorable to the energy sector and equities,\" Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read told clients this week, adding that a second Trump term that \"constrains\" the ET would benefit refiners, international oil companies (IOCs) and gas exploration and production companies. \"We expect a general deregulatory bent from both executive orders and even with legislation – depending on the outcome of the House.\" Defense stocks could also see some gains, according to Barclays analyst David Strauss. Even with an increasing federal deficit, he expects the defense budget to continue to increase under a Trump administration, a move that he said should be \"broadly supportive\" of defense and government services. \"We ultimately think a broad government fiscal reform program could be positive for defense, likely freeing up more funding to be put towards weapons development and procurement,\" the analyst wrote in a note to clients this week. Semiconductor stocks, which responded favorably to the election outcome, may also continue to benefit, even with Trump's hardline tariff strategy. The former president has signaled implementing sweeping tariffs, suggesting that he would propose 10% to 20% tariffs on all U.S. imports and tariffs of at least 60% on goods from China. Notably, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso believes that these tariffs will likely have a \"minimal impact\" on semis, given that only a minority of them are shipped to the U.S. He also notes that there likely won't be much more done in terms of restrictions for those companies tied to artificial intelligence. In light of this, CNBC Pro screened for stocks that have rallied after both of Trump's election wins and may still see more upside based on the following criteria: Saw at least a 10% gain from Nov. 7, 2016, to the end of that year after Trump's first win Saw at least a 2% gain on Wednesday after Trump's second win Are expected to see another 15% gain from here among analysts Below is the full list of stocks that made the cut. In the energy space, Texas-based oil company ConocoPhillips could be a major beneficiary of Trump's policies, including the expansion of drilling projects . While it hasn't been a great year for the stock — it's down nearly 4% year to date — it rose 4% on Wednesday after the election's result. Looking ahead, analysts expect ConocoPhillips to see more than 20% upside. That would be above the 14.2% rally the stock saw after Trump's first win from Nov. 7, 2016, until year's end. On the whole, Wall Street is majorly bullish on the name, as 21 of the 27 analysts covering it have a strong buy or buy rating. The remaining six analysts have taken a neutral stance. Defense company Huntington Ingalls is a standout stock. In Wednesday's session following Trump's second win, the industrial name advanced more than 5%, and analysts forecast about 16% upside to go. In 2016, it surged nearly 24% following Trump's first win until year-end. However, the Street is still largely neutral on the stock. Among the 15 analysts covering it, 11 have a hold rating, while only two have a strong buy or buy rating. The stock has also had a rough year, plummeting about 22%. Chip giant Advanced Micro Devices is a high-beta stock that could also benefit from a possible extension of the bull market and Trump's tax cuts. The stock rallied more than 2% on Wednesday after Trump's second win. Analysts – most of whom are bullish, with 43 of the 52 covering it having a strong buy or buy rating – see an average of more than 24% upside ahead. That would follow a monster rally after Trump's first win, which saw the stock gain almost 63% from Nov. 7, 2016, until the end of that year. While the stock has been marginally higher this year, it's plunged more than 14% over the past one month.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### TEXT: \n",
      "The earnings season is winding down, but there are several key companies still on deck to report. Of the nine S & P 500 companies scheduled to post their third-quarter results, Home Depot and Disney are among them. Investors will look to these results for clues on whether the stock market's postelection rally can continue. Thus far more than 450 S & P 500 names have posted their results. Of those, 74% have beaten earnings expectations, per FactSet. Below is a breakdown of what to expect from some of the S & P 500 members slated to report. All times are Eastern. Tuesday Home Depot is set to report earnings in the premarket. A call with management is slated for 9 a.m. Last quarter: HD said it sees sales weakening amid a more cautious customer . This quarter: Analysts polled by LSEG see a small year-over-year earnings decline for the home improvement giant. What CNBC is watching: UBS thinks same-store sales will be weak for Home Depot, citing weak demand. \"Further, we think ongoing pressure on larger projects pushed pros to engage in smaller projects. Still, newness and innovation likely prompted consumers to trade up in certain categories, providing top-line support,\" analyst Michael Lasser wrote Friday. What history shows: Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows Home Depot has beaten earnings expectations for 17 straight quarters. Live Nation Entertainment is set to report earnings before the bell, followed by a call at 9 a.m. Last quarter: LYV reported operating income that beat expectations, while revenue was in line with estimates, per StreetAccount. This quarter: The entertainment conglomerate is expected to report a 10% earnings decline from the year-earlier period, LSEG data shows. What CNBC is watching: Live Nation has been a clear winner in 2024, up 31% in that time, an Morgan Stanley expects that momentum to continue. The bank last week raised its price target to $140 from $120, implying upside of 13.8%. \"LYV remains our preferred exposure to strong consumer demand for live events and concerts. While less stadium activity in 3Q drives '24 slightly lower ... an improved '25 outlook drives up estimates & PT,\" the bank wrote. What history shows: Live Nation shares have risen after the last four earnings releases, per Bespoke. Thursday Walt Disney is set to report earnings in the premarket, with a call scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Last quarter: DIS beat estimates, with the company's combined streaming services turning a profit . This quarter: The media giant is expected to post earnings growth of more than 30% year on year, according to LSEG. What CNBC is watching: Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris thinks the key for investors will be Disney's guidance. \"Our updated FY25 estimates are 2% ahead of consensus on revenue and operating income, with the largest positive variances at Content, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC), and Experiences,\" he said last month. What history shows: Disney has not done well following the last two releases, losing 4.5% and 9.5%, respectively. Applied Materials is set to report earnings after the open. A call with management is set for 4:30 p.m. Last quarter: AMAT company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. This quarter: Analysts expect slight year-over-year earnings and revenue growth year on year, LSEG data shows. What CNBC is watching: Applied Materials has lagged the broader semiconductor sector this year, rising more than 18% while the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has soared 48% in that time. Can this week's report spark a catch-up trade for the stock? What history shows: Applied Materials shares average a gain of 0.8% on earnings days, per Bespoke.\n",

      "Three China stocks that analysts are watching for longer-term opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Chinese stocks wrapped up a momentous week marked by a $1.4 trillion debt swap program that fell short of many investors' calls for more direct government support. For many, the reaction among investors only reinforced the need to look at longer-term opportunities in individual stocks that haven't changed. The Ministry of Finance signaled at a closely watched press conference Friday that more fiscal support could come next year , while in the near term it focused on addressing local government debt. The relatively muted measures come as China gears up for heightened trade relations with the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose high tariffs on imported goods. Through it all, the CSI 300 stock index in Shanghair managed to rise nearly 6.6% last week, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rallied 3.2%. Stopping further weakness On a macroeconomic level, China is trying to ensure inflation and employment don't deteriorate further, said Liqian Ren, leader of quantitative investment at WisdomTree. While Ren doesn't expect a return to rapid growth, she is watching how Chinese companies are able to build up their brands and charge a premium, maturing from models that previously competed only on price. \"So I think consumer companies like Anta , I think not many people have understood outside China, but it is really becoming the world's leading sportswear company,\" Ren said. \"I think they are also going to make a global play soon. But not many Americans know about the brand.\" But if Anta continues on its present path, perhaps in 10 years consumers will regard the company the same as \"Adidas or other so called foreign sports brands,\" Ren said. \"That's one thing that I am personally paying attention to.\" Hong Kong-listed Anta sells sportswear under its own brand while owning Fila and high-end brand Descente, among others. The company said in October that Anta-brand retail sales for the third quarter rose by the mid-single digits from a year ago, while that of Fila weakened and other brands surged by as much as 50%. Anta shares are up 18% so far in 2024. China's efforts to rival foreign brands have not diminished, regardless of the slowdown. Baidu is reportedly scheduled Tuesday to release its own artificial intelligence-connected glasses, vying with Meta's RayBans product. Xpeng expansion Electric car startup Xpeng in the past week announced its own humanoid robot , and a new $26,000 car called the P7+ that's already racked up more than 30,000 preorders for deliveries due to start this month. The products are largely only going to be available in China, at least initially. \"For Chinese EVs, the door is now closed, and re-shoring is impractical,\" Macquarie analysts said in a Nov. 7 report. \"Our top pick is XPeng, a China pure play.\" \"XPeng has no exposure to the U.S. market and no current plans to enter the market,\" the analysts said. \"Domestic volume has room to ramp quickly, led by new competitive models like the M03 and P7+. The successful launch of the M03 has helped to alleviate investor concerns about supply chain management and product competitiveness.\" \"Upcoming catalysts, such as the pure-vision ADAS M03 and the launch of a hybrid system car could benefit from domestic confidence/consumption recovery and are unaffected by geopolitical events,\" the Macquarie analysts said. About half of Xpeng's 20,000-plus deliveries in each of the past two months have come from its lower-priced Mona M03 car. In the consumer sector, Macquarie's top pick is Yum China , which operates Pizza Hut and KFC in China. \"YUMC is our top idea in the consumer sector given that it is a pure domestic market play,\" the analysts said. \"The company's strategy shift towards franchisee stores and new store format K COFFEE as well as Pizza Hut WoW would be a secular growth driver, which can decouple from geopolitical risk.\" Yum China has ramped up shareholder return targets to $4.5 billion in 2026 from $3 billion in 2024, they added. Yum China on Nov. 4 reported third-quarter earnings, showing operating profit grew by 15% year-on-year to $371 million. Xpeng is due to release quarterly results on Nov. 19. In the week ahead, internet giants Tencent and Alibaba both report earnings. The central government is scheduled Friday Nov. 15 to release retail sales and industrial data for October. \"You have to be very willing to suffer the negative sentiment to invest in China,\" Ren said. There are often \"long stretch[es] of negative sentiment which really test a person's risk-taking.\" But she also highlighted that Chinese stocks can serve as a hedge to other equity markets. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "Wall Street analysts are looking ahead to President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House, and many stocks could be poised to benefit. CNBC Pro combed through the most recent Wall Street research to find companies analysts really like heading into 2025 based on potential Trump policies. They include General Motors, Ford Motor, Robinhood , Coinbase , GE Aerospace and Goldman Sachs. Ford and General Motors Bank of America said both automakers are best positioned in a Trump presidency. \"We see F and GM as the main beneficiaries from the Trump administration,\" analyst John Murphy wrote. This is because there will be less pressure to shift the auto companies toward electric vehicles, he added. \"On the other end, EV OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] may face slower demand due to less pressure to go electric and lower IRA incentives.\" Murphy said Mexico tariffs are a risk, but he urged investors to remain calm. Shares of Ford are down 10% in 2024, and General Motors is up close to 55% this year. Coinbase and Robinhood Needham analyst John Todaro sees both stocks as beneficiaries of a crypto renaissance under a Trump administration, although the firm currently has a neutral rating on Robinhood. \"We expect the entire crypto sector to benefit from the Trump win, but the largest positive impact on COIN & HOOD,\" he wrote. Todaro said both companies may feel more compelled to usher in additional crypto products under a Trump presidency that may be more amenable to bitcoin uses. \"In addition to Trump winning, the House and Senate (elected & re-elected) majority pro crypto candidates to make the most pro-crypto political landscape in US history,\" he added. Shares of Robinhood are up nearly 140% in 2024, while Coinbase is up more than 55% this year. GE Aerospace The aerospace company has pricing power, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle, who says GE can benefit under a Trump administration. \"In the event that some combination of increased fiscal spending, tax cuts, and tariffs were to drive persistency to the current above-trend rate of inflation, then we think companies in our coverage with the greatest pricing power would continue to stand out as relative winners,\" he wrote, including GE in that mix. Defense spending is also likely to rise under a GOP White House, making GE a standout, the analyst added. The company is a key engine supplier on U.S. military aircraft as well as internationally. \"Additionally, we think GE could be among the largest beneficiaries of this potential trend within our aerospace coverage,\" Deuschle said. The stock is up more than 80% this year with more room to run, he wrote. Ford and GM – Bank of America, buy ratings \"We see F and GM as the main beneficiaries from the Trump administration. The current environmental regime would pressure the core business of legacy OEMs (trucks) to decarbonize by the end of the decade while shifting quickly to an EV portfolio. … On the other end, EV OEMs may face slower demand due to less pressure to go electric and lower IRA incentives.\" Coinbase – Needham, buy rating; Robinhood – Needham, neutral rating \"On the back of this, we expect HOOD in the medium term to launch more crypto products as well as COIN and would expect more favorable outcomes on the SEC cases. In addition to Trump winning, the House and Senate (elected & re-elected) majority pro crypto candidates to make the most pro-crypto political landscape in US history.\" GE Aerospace – Deutsche Bank, buy rating \"In the event that some combination of increased fiscal spending, tax cuts, & tariffs were to drive persistency to the current above-trend rate of inflation, then we think companies in our coverage with the greatest pricing power would continue to stand out as relative winners. … Additionally, we think GE could be among the largest beneficiaries of this [defense spend] potential trend within our aerospace coverage...\" Goldman Sachs – Wells Fargo, overweight rating \"Capital markets momentum and the chance for a super cycle. More free markets imply that investment banking revenues have a chance at exceeding 2021 levels over the next few years. The idea of a capital markets super-cycle seems possible (albeit not a base case), esp. given the level of pent-up demand, dry powder, and likely more certainty in deals getting approved.

      "The new Trump administration will offer a good backdrop for crypto-related stocks, according to Piper Sandler. Cryptocurrency-linked assets surged on Wednesday following Trump's victory. The president-elect has indicated his support for the industry, and more favorable regulations under a new administration could continue to send digital currencies like bitcoin to new all-time heights . On Wednesday, bitcoin rallied above $76,000 for the first time in history. \"Early in the election cycle, President-elect Trump came out in support of crypto and was viewed as the most crypto friendly candidate in the race,\" wrote Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley in a note Thursday. \"Since then we've seen a broader bi-partisan, pro-crypto shift in D.C. with > 200 pro-crypto candidates elected [Tuesday]. Given this shift in sentiment we expect to see comprehensive crypto legislation passed in the coming quarters and believe regulatory clarity will result in further mainstream crypto adoption.\" Against this more favorable backdrop, Moley shared several stocks he currently rates overweight and that offer investors exposure to the crypto industry: The Piper Sandler analyst highlighted Robinhood as \"the most attractive way to play the crypto space\" within his coverage universe. Shares of the financial trading platform have more than doubled this year, surging 130%. Moley estimated that crypto made up around 13% of Robinhood's revenues in the past 12 months. \"Its monetized crypto offering is significantly more robust than traditional retail brokerage peers, with over 15 tokens available to trade,\" the analyst wrote of Robinhood. \"When a comprehensive regulatory framework around crypto is eventually introduced in the U.S., we believe HOOD will likely look to expand its crypto offering by (1) increasing the number of tokens available for trading on its platform and (2) introducing new products like staking (and possibly lending) to a customer base ready to adopt new crypto products.\" Still, Moley's $30 price target on Robinhood is only a fraction above where the stock closed Thursday. Moley was also bullish on shares of CME Group , up 5% this year. While crypto is currently an \"immaterial\" part of CME's business — making up less than 1% of its revenue in the past 12 months — the company is the \"premier venue for commercial & institutional users of crypto derivatives,\" the analyst wrote. \"CME currently offers 9 different crypto contracts across BTC (5) and ETH (4). However, through its partnership with CF Benchmarks it has an additional 28 reference rates that we think it could look to launch new contracts on if regulatory clarity improves,\" the analyst added. Moley's $250 price target implies that CME stock could add another 13% over the next 12 months. Although crypto made up less than 5% of Virtu Financial 's revenue in the past year, Moley said that the platform was \"quietly operating as one of the major traditional finance players in the crypto space.\" \"The market maker is currently an authorized participant on ALL of the publicly traded spot bitcoin & ether ETFs (20+) and we think the future launch of options on these spot crypto ETFs could add another layer to VIRT's crypto revenues,\" the analyst wrote. \"All in all, as crypto's presence in traditional finance evolves, we think VIRT is positioned well to benefit.\" Shares of Virtu Financial have climbed 65% in 2024. Moley's $35 price target is nearly 5% higher than where the stock closed on Thursday. Finally, Moley gave an honorable mention to trading platform Cboe Global Markets . Less than 1% of the Cboe's revenue was derived from crypto assets in the last 12 months. The company \"offers & clears cash-settled bitcoin & ether futures contracts,\" Moley wrote, and \"recently exited its spot digital asset trading platform and consolidated its digital asset derivatives into its existing Global Derivatives & Clearing Business.\" Shares of Cboe have added 12% this year, trailing the broader market, and Moley's $220 price target implies an additional 9% upside.\n",

      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Several software companies could be due for a pullback after the stock market's roaring rally this week, fueled by President-elect Donald Trump's election victory as well as robust quarterly earnings reports. Major U.S. indexes are on track for major wins this month, with the S & P 500 up roughly 5% and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average higher by 5.3%, putting both on track for their best gain in a year. The Nasdaq has jumped 6.4% so far in November. Investors are buoyed by the prospect of less government regulation of business, more deal-making and proposed tax cuts under a second Trump administration. But amid these bullish moves and renewed market enthusiasm, shares of some companies that have raced ahead this month could be due for a pullback according to one popular market yardstick. CNBC Pro screened for stocks that are considered technically overbought using their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI, a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the speed and magnitude of a stock price. Companies with a 14-day RSI higher than 70 are generally regarded as overbought, signaling a potential pullback ahead, while a 14-day RSI below 30 suggests a stock is oversold and may be poised for a bounce higher. Shares of video game makers Take-Two Interactive Software and Electronic Arts are two of the stocks that are technically overbought right now, according to the analysis. Take-Two shares added more than 8% this week on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results. The company reported $1.47 billion in revenue in its fiscal second quarter, topping analysts' consensus estimate of $1.43 billion, according to LSEG. Several brokers adjusted their price targets on Take-Two after its earnings results. Morgan Stanley kept an overweight rating while lifting its target by $15 to $200, saying the company \"continued showing strong results, particularly in mobile, as the focus remains on [Grand Theft Auto] the pipeline.\" That suggests 11.6% potential upside. Take-Two's RSI is nearly 84.8, however, suggesting the stock has risen too far, too fast, and may prove vulnerable to a downdraft. Electronic Arts, another software company, has an RSI even higher, at about 85.2. The stock is up 5% this month, after its second-quarter net bookings came in better than expected and set a quarterly record. Analysts were enthused by revenue and strong execution from the company's sports portfolio, especially college football, and its recent Dragon Age: The Veilguard video game launch. The most overbought stock this week was human capital management software company Dayforce, with an RSI of 92.4. The stock was also considered overbought in late October. Shares are up more than 33% over the past month and hit a new 52-week high on Friday. Other stocks that could be due for a pullback are Paycom Software and pharmaceutical companies Incyte and Gilead Sciences . In addition, take a look at the market's most oversold names from our CNBC Pro screener: Packaged food and consumer goods companies General Mills , Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr Pepper are now considered oversold. Consumer staples has been one of the slower-growing sectors this year, and is down 1.7% this quarter. But higher prices and expectations of normalizing pricing, which helped Coke guide its organic revenue growth this year to the high end of a prior forecast, could lead the stocks higher. Other oversold stocks include power generation company AES , as well as radio frequency equipment maker Qorvo and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals — the latter two of which were also oversold the previous week.\n",

      "The 10-year Treasury yield has been rising. Here's where BlackRock’s Rick Rieder sees an opportunity\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Opportunities abound for income-seeking investors, even as the 10-year Treasury has seen a volatile week, according to BlackRock's Rick Rieder. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has been steadily climbing this fall, taking a sharper turn higher as Election Day approached. The rate was at about 4% a month ago, and surged 15 basis points to top 4.4% on Wednesday in the wake of Donald Trump winning a second term in the White House. The 10-year yield has cooled since then. It traded at roughly 4.3% on Friday, one day after the Federal Reserve dialed back interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Bond yields and prices have an inverse relationship, so yields rise when prices fall. Further, bonds that have longer maturities tend to have greater price sensitivity to fluctuations in rates, which is known as duration. Longer-dated issues, such as the 10-year Treasury, have faced considerable volatility and seen their prices slide lately, pushing up yields. But investors don't have to anchor themselves too far out on the yield curve to snap up solid income, said Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, in a phone call with CNBC. \"I think fixed income is interesting,\" he said. \"There is so much yield everywhere.\" Managing duration risk Rieder, who is also a portfolio manager on the iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC) , likes the front end and the belly of the yield curve, aiming for a duration of about three to four years. Issues that are closer to the front of the curve tend to have shorter duration, and thus less price sensitivity to swings in rates. Corners of the market he finds attractive today include high-yield bonds — or those issues with a rating below BBB from Standard & Poor's or below Baa from Moody's Ratings. They also tend to have relatively shorter duration compared with other fixed-income assets. The iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (USHY) , for instance, has a duration of 3.2 years and a 30-day SEC yield of 7.22%. Meanwhile, the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund (VWEHX) has an average duration of 2.9 years, and a 30-day SEC yield of 6.03%. These bonds are riskier than their investment grade counterparts and Treasurys, but they can offer some diversification benefits in a broad fixed-income portfolio. Collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, are another favorite for Rieder. \"I love the CLO market, and it's one of the best opportunities today,\" he said. CLOs are floating rate loans made to businesses, which can themselves be non-investment grade. The loans are made up of tranches with their own risk characteristics. Those that are deemed AAA by ratings agencies are at the front of the line to get paid if a borrower has to be restructured, recapitalized or goes bankrupt. Investors piled into CLO ETFs earlier this year as a play on the higher-rate environment . Though their short-duration nature means that their income could come down as rates fall, portfolio managers who specialize in the sector say CLO ETFs still offer attractive returns compared with other fixed-income classes. \"You can stay higher quality, floating rate oriented, and clip yield,\" Rieder said. The iShares AAA CLO Active ETF (CLOA) has a duration of less than a year and a 30-day SEC yield of 6.24%. The Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) is one of the big players in the CLO ETF space, with a 30-day SEC yield of 6.32% and a duration of less than a year. Rieder also likes fixed income in Europe and securitized assets. He thinks it's prime time for income investors to snap up yield without stretching into lower quality. \"There are epic amounts of cash sitting out here, and if you can get that yield and marry it to an equity portfolio, I think it makes a ton of sense,\" he said.\n",

      "Inflation data in the week ahead could determine whether a stock market that surged to all-time highs after Donald Trump 's decisive victory can continue to push higher. The October consumer and producer prices data are set to release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates this week by a quarter percentage point in what was a widely anticipated move. A cooler inflation print that confirms the central bank can continue its easing cycle will support a stock market that's been on a tear, in part because of stabilizing prices and a somewhat softening labor market. On the other hand, a hotter number that threatens that narrative could upend those gains. \"One of the legs of the stool that the market sits on right now at this level is the fact that the Fed is cutting rates,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. \"And I would certainly say anything that changes that opinion could certainly tip the apple cart over.\" .SPX 5D mountain S & P 500, over five days For the moment, investors are optimistic the Fed is on pace to get back to neutral, meaning the Fed funds target rate will return to a level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary for the economy. Markets are currently pricing in a 64% likelihood the Fed will lower rates by another quarter point in December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . The overnight lending rate is expected to end 2025 somewhere between 3.5% and 4%, down from the 4.5% to 4.75% range where it sits currently. Key inflation When it comes to economist projections, at least, the consumer price index, or CPI, next week should give investors little reason to change their outlook on interest rates, though concerns linger. The October CPI is expected to have risen 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, the same as in the prior month, according to economists polled by FactSet. On a yearly basis, it's expected to have ticked higher by 2.5%, up from 2.4% in the previous reading. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have held steady at 0.3% and 3.3% on a monthly and yearly basis, respectively. Meanwhile, the October producer price index, which excludes shelter, is set to have risen 0.3%, consensus estimates show, up from a 0.0% reading the prior month. On a yearly basis, it's expected to have risen by 2.3%, up from 1.8% previously. \"We've been concerned that inflation is sticky, and likely to creep back up due to base effects and shelter,\" said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments. \"And I think that's because the market expects for interest rates to be higher for longer.\" 'Trump trade' Of course, there seems to be little that can get in the way of the equity rally as of late, with the \"Trump trade\" leading to investor euphoria in broad swaths of the market. This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 44,000 for the first time ever , while the S & P 500 did the same, briefly crossing 6,000 to its own milestone. The Nasdaq Composite also notched an intraday record. Financial stocks have surged on promises of lower corporate taxes, as did stocks in the biotech sector that could see a rise in merger and acquisition activity. Bitcoin surged , gold faltered . Small caps rallied . Oil stocks rebounded, and renewable energy tumbled. China-exposed stocks dropped. Even with this surge, many investors continue to be bullish on the market because of a strong fundamental backdrop. Investors are wrapping up an upbeat third-quarter reporting season, with roughly 74% of the 450 S & P 500 companies that have reported thus far posting positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The U.S. economy is robust, with the Atlanta Fed projecting real GDP growth of 2.5% in the fourth quarter. Markets even absorbed a surge in bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield appearing to calm down at the tail end of this week, below 4.5%. US10Y 5D mountain U.S. 10-year Treasury yield Even so, there are concerns, including a lack of clarity yet on the control of Congress, which could determine whether tax cuts will be extended past 2025. Investors are also considering whether the tariffs proposed by the president-elect could be inflationary, and if the promise of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants will hurt domestic productivity. \"For the time being, it appears as if the markets have been able to sort of focus on the positive implications of this new administration,\" Hogan said, and \"whistle by the grave on the potential negatives.\" Week ahead calendar All times ET.

      "Tesla and a handful of other so-called Trump trades led the market rally this week as investors welcomed the Republican's victory in the presidential election. The S & P 500 has climbed more than 4% since Monday began, touching above 6,000 and on track to notch its best week in about a year. These gains came as traders focused in on the outcomes of Tuesday's presidential election and Thursday's interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Excluding stocks that reported earnings this week, some of the best performers were those viewed as tied to Donald Trump 's win. Trump trades can earn that title by being part of sectors such as financials or energy viewed as beneficiaries of his expected shifts away from regulation, among other things. CNBC screened for the Trump trade names that led the index higher this week and did not report earnings. Here are the top performers, as of Friday before the bell: Tesla led the way with a gain of 19.3%. The electric vehicle maker is one of the best-known Trump trades given CEO Elon Musk 's advocacy for the president-elect on the campaign trail. The stock, which touched new 52-week highs this week, is now up more than 27% in 2024. This week's rally propelled the Texas-based company's market cap above $1 trillion on Friday. Many on Wall Street expect a pullback, with the typical price target of analysts polled by LSEG implying shares can tumble more than 29%. But Bank of America analyst John Murphy raised his price target to $350 from $265, which now suggests upside of 17.9%. Murphy cited Musk's connection to Trump as one reason for the change. He also reiterated his buy rating, putting him in the majority on the Street. \"Our analysis has shown that TSLA should be relatively indifferent directly to most policies discussed in our recent election note, but may benefit from a shift to a federal regulation of autonomous vehicles/full self-driving (FSD) nationwide,\" Murphy wrote. \"In addition, it is difficult to judge how Elon Musk's increasingly close public relationship with President Trump could benefit Tesla, but this needs to be monitored closely.\" \"We believe these factors, and potentially others, should support TSLA's growth trajectory and thereby the higher earnings multiple,\" he added. TSLA 5D mountain Tesla, 5 days Discover , meanwhile, is an example of a financial stock that has rallied along with the sector. Shares climbed more than 15% this week, bringing its year-to-date gain above 55%. But Wall Street is wary looking ahead. The average analyst expects shares to fall around 12% and has a hold rating, according to LSEG. Baker Hughes was one of the best energy stocks this week with a jump of nearly 14%. It is now on track to end 2024 up more than 25%, which would mark its fourth straight winning year. Following this run, the average analyst surveyed by LSEG sees the stock gaining slightly under 3% over the next year. Most analysts have buy ratings on the stock.

      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Wall Street is questioning how potential tariffs on imports under a Trump administration could affect artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and the broader industry . The president-elect, whose successful reelection campaign defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, has touted tariffs on imports and attacked the CHIPS Act implemented under President Joe Biden, which aims to foster chipmaker manufacturing in the U.S. Earlier this year, Trump accused Taiwan of stealing the chipmaking business from the U.S. and said he would impose tariffs as president. Many U.S.-based companies heavily rely on the Taiwan-based suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for key components used to build AI tools. A tariff could increase the costs of goods throughout the supply chain. \"There could be some pins and needles as we get into early 2025, but the initial read from the industry is that NVIDIA is the golden child of AI, and Trump is not going to damage anything related to godfather of AI [Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang],\" said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. However, many investors expect the company to shake off these concerns, given their high margins, predominantly U.S.-based customers and posterchild position. The stock has managed to shake off those fears thus far, rising 9% week to date. NVDA 5D mountain Shares over the last week If the administration implements tariffs, Ives believes Nvidia could gain some workaround given its integral status. That could come in the form of excluding some of its next AI chips and graphics processing units from the tariff wave expected in spring 2025. \"If we are going to have the tariffs, it means that the relative position of Nvidia against its competitors doesn't really change too much,\" said Hua Cheng, portfolio manager at Mirova. \"The competitive advantages of Nvidia is more or less the same in that case.\" Many investors also view Trump as a proponent of AI innovation. That is due in part to his close connection to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, which Ives said may have helped some investors shake off fears of tariff-induced supply chain disruptions this week. Bank of America's trading desk also highlighted in a recent note to clients that Musk has been a \"vocal user, buyer and fan\" of the companies' chips as Tesla builds out AI tools for xAI. \"[T]he election changes nothing here,\" wrote Mizuho's Jordan Klein. \"Spending will accelerate big time and more cloud capex move into this sector as NVDA's new higher speed Blackwell system ramps. It would be like trying to host a Formula 1 race on a dirt track.\"\n",

      "In the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, the technology sector stands poised for renewed momentum, echoing the performance seen during his 2016 presidency. A pro-business agenda, regulatory flexibility, and potential tax incentives under his administration could once again set the stage for technology stocks to outperform. Adobe (ADBE) , a leader in AI-enhanced creative solutions, is particularly well-positioned to capitalize on this environment. Following a record earnings report that underscores the demand for its Digital Media, Document Cloud, and AI-driven creative tools, Adobe's recent oversold conditions offer a rare opportunity for investors to add exposure at a reasonable valuation. With its superior growth rates and operational margins that set it apart from peers, Adobe's valuation presents a compelling entry point amid strong fundamentals and a supportive administration. Adobe recently reached oversold conditions on both daily and weekly timeframes and recently showed signs of positive divergence. This signals that sellers are starting to get exhausted and presents an opportunity for buyers to start stepping in for a strong counter-trend rally. The stock has been trading in a broad range but shows resilience near recent support levels, indicating a solid base from which it could move higher. This set-up offers an attractive risk/reward entry point for adding bullish exposure. Adobe's fundamentals are strong, with a 10% year-over-year increase in revenue to a record $4.89 billion. The company also achieved notable growth across its core segments: Digital Media, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud, which grew by 11%, 15%, and 11%, respectively. Adobe's operating margins remain impressive at 25.6%, significantly higher than the industry average of 16.8%, while the stock trades at only 23.5x forward earnings, compared to the industry average of 27.8 times. With growth rates and margins that exceed the industry, ADBE's 15% discount reflects a substantial upside opportunity from a valuation perspective. To capitalize on a potential rally in Adobe, consider buying the December 20, 2024, $500/550 Call Vertical @ $18.05 Debit. This position entails: Buying 1 Dec 20, 2024, $500 Call @ $27.40 Selling 1 Dec 20, 2024, $550 Call @ $9.35 This call spread strategy allows for significant upside potential with limited risk. The maximum potential reward is $3,195, achieved if ADBE closes above $550 at expiration, while the maximum risk is capped at $1,805 if ADBE remains below $500 at expiration. Given Adobe's technical and fundamental strengths, this strategy aligns with the bullish thesis and benefits from a potential rally in ADBE shares driven by AI advancements and continued revenue growth.

Feldman cited upcoming Fed rate cuts as a catalyst. Home Depot is one company that should benefit from an easing monetary cycle, since lower interest rates could boost increased consumer spending in home improvement going forward. The Fed has embarked on a new rate-cutting cycle as inflation pressures have eased. On Thursday, the Fed lowered rates by a quarter percentage point . Traders expect another quarter-point reduction in December . Home Depot can also benefit from hurricane recovery in the coming months following hurricanes Helene and Milton. This recovery could last through multiple quarters in 2025, according to Telsey.

      "\n",
      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Former U.S. President Donald Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in this week's election has raised questions about how Asia will be impacted. \"At face value, Trump 2.0 is bad news for Asia, esp[ecially] China,\" analysts at Macquarie Research wrote in a Nov. 7 note, given the president-elect's plans to raise tariffs and cut taxes. \"When passed, the [tariffs] will sweep across Asia, particularly China [and] should spike volatility and compress multiples as uncertainty prevails.\" Even so, the analysts say the region is \"more prepared than in 2016\" and investment opportunities remain, especially given the weaker yen and stimulus in China. Market reaction to the election result has been mixed, with India's Nifty 50 index falling over 1% and Japan's Nikkei 225 slipping 0.25% on Thursday. In China, meanwhile, the blue-chip CSI 300 index closed over 3% higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 2% as economic data and hopes of further stimulus boosted stocks. The market moves in Asia come after a surge in U.S. stocks on Wednesday pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average , S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to new all-time highs. The \"positive reaction to the stock market,\" follows reduced political uncertainties, Tai Hui, APAC chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said. Sectors to watch Looking ahead, Hui believes \"an economic soft landing and steady rate cuts by the Fed[eral Reserve] should be positive for both stocks and bonds, as well as selective alternative assets, such as infrastructure and transportation.\" This will bring about \"structural shifts in global supply chain ... [and] could boost infrastructure spending in ASEAN and South Asia,\" he added. Touching on the impact of potential tariffs on imports — especially from China — into the U.S., the strategist believes the \"direct earnings impact ... is likely to be limited, given [that] more than 85% of MSCI China's primary revenue comes from mainland China.\" \"While slower exports would impact domestic investment and consumption indirectly, Beijing's fiscal and monetary policies could offer some offset. Hence, the possible measures from this week's [National People's Congress] meeting could be material in countering investors' concerns from external factors,\" he added. Stocks to play As investors await the outcomes of the closely-watched meeting by China's top legislature, Macquarie is looking to \"domestic pure plays,\" such as fast-food restaurant chain Yum China . The analysts also like automotive manufacturer XPeng in the electric vehicle space as the nation's \"energy transition and battery supply chain will likely see multiples compress on rising uncertainty.\" Over in Japan, the Australian investment bank is betting on equities expected to benefit from a weaker yen. The currency has fallen versus the dollar following Trump's win, hitting 154.7 per dollar on Wednesday — its weakest level since July 30. On Thursday it recovered some ground to trade around 153.64. Macquarie's top Japan picks include test equipment manufacturer Advantest , electronics and electric vehicle manufacturer Mitsubishi Electric and electrical equipment manufacturer Mitsubishi Heavy . It also sees potential in Japanese pharma companies like Daiichi Sankyo and Chugai Pharmaceutical . Elsewhere, the bank still favors tech despite increased potential tariffs on Asian exports, saying top picks TSMC , semiconductor giant SK Hynix , infrastructure service provider Quanta Services and smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi remain good bets. — CNBC's Lim Hui Jie contributed to this report.\n",

      "First Solar has tumbled nearly 17% over the past month as the solar sector has broadly sold off in tandem with President-elect Donald Trump's rise, but some analysts see the dip as a buying opportunity. \"As the dust settles, we think FSLR will emerge a winner,\" Michael Blum, an analyst at Wells Fargo, told clients in a Wednesday note. First Solar is the largest manufacturer of solar panels in the U.S. and is rated overweight at Wells Fargo. Republicans will probably seek to repeal some parts of the Inflation Reduction Act if they win both chambers of Congress, according to the Wall Street bank. But the domestic manufacturing tax credits that benefit First Solar are likely to survive because they support jobs in GOP congressional districts, according to the bank. Trump has also threatened stiff tariffs on China, which would benefit First Solar by reducing competition. Tailwinds from tariffs, however, would be offset by headwinds from IRA repeal if the GOP goes after the manufacturing tax credits. In the universe of publicly traded solar stocks, however, analysts view First Solar as best positioned to weather the storm. \"We reiterate our Buy on FSLR due to its domestic manufacturing base,\" Dimple Gosai, a Bank of America analyst, told clients in a note on Wednesday. \"In our view, higher tariffs on imported solar panels would diminish competition from Chinese manufacturers, pushing demand towards First Solar's U.S.-made products.\" Bank of America has a price target of $259 for First Solar, implying about 33% upside from Wednesday's close of $194.02 per share.\n",

Its $86 price target for U.S. Cellular reflects 32% upside, while Telephone and Data Systems' target of $51 implies more than 56% upside, as of Wednesday's close.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### TEXT: \n",
      "Dutch tech behemoth ASML has been a favorite among investors in recent years, but Goldman Sachs has adopted a cautious stance on the stock and removed it from its conviction list of top picks. This follows a \"weak earnings update\" in the third quarter, the investment bank's analysts wrote in a Nov. 4 research note. ASML's net bookings for the third quarter were 2.6 billion euros ($2.79 billion), below the 5.6 billion euros penciled in by Wall Street analysts. Net sales, however, came in higher than expectations at 7.5 billion euros. ASML expects net sales for 2025 to come in at the lower of half of the 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros range it previously predicted. Against this backdrop, Goldman's analysts noted that \"visibility on near-term earnings is lower post the 3Q update,\" for ASML. Besides ASML, Goldman also removed brewer Heineken and electronics giant Philips from its Europe conviction list for November, and refreshed it by adding Coca-Cola HBC (Hellenic Bottling Company) and JD Sports . The stocks are featured in the investment bank's \"Conviction List - Directors' Cut,\" which it says offers a \"curated and active\" list of buy-rated stocks. They are selected by a subcommittee in each region which \"collaborate with each sector analyst to identify top ideas that offer a combination of conviction, a differentiated view and high risk-adjusted returns,\" Goldman Sachs says. Coca-Cola HBC Goldman is betting on Coca-Cola HBC, also known as CCH, given its solid top-lines and strong margin uplift. \"CCH's best-in-class execution and innovation pipeline led by Coca-Cola should drive volume growth and positive mix,\" the investment bank noted. CCH is a partner of Coca-Cola and bottles and sells its beverages. The company said its organic revenue was up 13.9% in the third quarter , exceeding the 10.8% penciled by analysts. It now expects organic revenue growth between 11% and 13%, compared with a previous forecast range of 8% to 12%, for the full-year 2024. Analyst Olivier Nicolai expects the company's full-year 2024 and full-year 2025 sales to exceed consensus by 2% and 1% respectively \"driven by his bullish organic sales growth expectations on volume and positive price-mix.\" He is also expecting the CCH to have \"continued positive earnings momentum.\" Shares of CCH are listed on the London Stock Exchange and as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) in the U.S. under the CCHGY ticker. Its shares are up nearly 23.6% year-to-date. Goldman has a 12-month target price of £30 ($41.31) on the stock, implying a 12.6% potential upside. JD Sports Also on Goldman's list is British sneaker and sports fashion retailer JD Sports . The stock is now trading at a \"depressed multiple\" of 9.7 times price-to-earnings, but is \"well-positioned for [a] sportswear recovery,\" the investment bank noted. The comments come as the \"sportswear industry is emerging out of a challenging period, with inventory normalization largely done and high-frequency trackers pointing to retailer markdown activity back in-line with 2019 levels, following a period of elevated discounting\" it wrote. This phenomenon — coupled with an improving product pipeline across brands — has pushed analyst Richard Edwards to an \"above consensus view\" on JD's LFL (like-for-like) sales growth. Edwards also expects space expansion and acquisitions to contribute to an average 10% sales growth from 2025 to 2027, above the consensus average of 7%. Shares of JD Sports are listed on the London Stock Exchange and as an ADR in the U.S. under the JDSPY ticker. Its shares are down nearly 24.2% year-to-date. Goldman has a 12-month target price of £1.90 on the stock, implying nearly 50% potential upside. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "Donald Trump 's decisive victory in the U.S. presidential election has spooked clean energy investors that the Inflation Reduction Act could be on the chopping block. Solar stocks sold off steeply Wednesday in response. Whether the IRA faces a serious threat will depend on whether Republicans secure both houses of Congress. The GOP has won the Senate, but it is still unclear which party will gain a majority in the House of Representatives. Trump's campaign platform says he will seek to terminate the \"Socialist Green New Deal,\" a reference to the IRA. The law has facilitated a clean energy boom in the U.S. The three stocks that have the most exposure to the IRA are Array Technologies , First Solar and SolarEdge , according to a Wednesday note from Goldman Sachs. Array is forecast to receive $80 million in domestic manufacturing tax credits in 2026 or about 35% of the company's estimated non-GAAP earnings per share, according to Goldman. The company, which makes devices that allow solar panels to track, was down nearly 20% on Wednesday. First Solar is projected to book $2 billion in IRA tax credits in 2026 or 70% of its estimated non-GAAP earnings per share, according to Goldman. The solar panel manufacturer tumbled about 11% after Trump's victory. SolarEdge is expected to receive $164 million in IRA tax benefits in 2026 or about 84% of its estimated non-GAAP earnings per share. The company, which makes inverters for residential solar installations, fell about 20% on Wednesday.\n",

Trump secured a second term by penetrating the so-called Blue Wall and winning Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \"More free markets imply that investment banking revenues have a chance at exceeding 2021 levels over the next few years,\" Mayo said. \"The idea of a capital markets super-cycle seems possible (albeit not a base case), [especially] given the level of pent-up demand, dry powder, and likely more certainty in deals getting approved.\" Banking stocks were broadly higher in trading Wednesday. Shares of Goldman Sachs surged more than 12%, while peers Citigroup , Bank of America and Wells Fargo all gained more than 7% each. \"The chance for more loan growth seems higher now that the election is behind and corporates are likely to have a more 'risk on' attitude,\" Mayo continued. \"This is a key debate given that more loan growth can lead to more [net interest income], revenue, and EPS growth.\" The analyst also noted that Trump's plan for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate could be a \"wildcard\" that also benefits the banking sector.\n",

      "Here are Wednesday's biggest calls on Wall Street: Bernstein reiterates Apple as outperform The firm said Apple has some \"downside\" risk in a China tariff war but that it's sticking with its outperform rating on the stock. \"We suspect China may be hesitant to impose tax or other penalties on consumer electronics, given such penalties would likely hurt both Chinese workers and consumers, in addition to the desired impact on foreign equity holders. However, there is a risk that China retaliates with incremental targeted taxes on certain companies.\" Goldman Sachs reiterates Nvidia as buy Goldman said the stock is best positioned ahead of earnings later this month. \"With NVDA still trading well below its past 3-year median P/E multiple relative to our broader coverage universe, we believe the stock is set up well to sustain its outperformance.\" JPMorgan upgrades Yum China to overweight from neutral JPMorgan upgraded the China operator of brands like KFC following earnings. \"As a result, we see sector-wide discounting level narrowing and market leaders further consolidating the industry. YUMC has achieved positive traffic growth with yoy margin improvement in 3Q24. This is rare in the retailing industry, and YUMC has proven its execution capability – cost saving and efficiency improvement, offsetting the drag from ASP cuts and sales deleverage.\" Bernstein initiates Insulet as outperform Bernstein said the insulin pump company is well positioned for upside. \"We are initiating coverage of Insulet (PODD) with a TP of $300 (26% upside). Innovation is driving accelerated insulin pump market growth, PODD has a strong moat around the winning form factor, and the type 2 opportunity should drive significant upside to numbers.\" Wedbush reiterates Tesla as outperform The firm said the EV maker is a big winner of a Trump presidency. \"The biggest positive from a Trump win would be for Tesla and Musk. We believe a Trump presidency would be an overall negative for the EV industry as likely the EV rebates/tax incentives get pulled, however for Tesla we see this as a huge positive.\" Jefferies initiates Ryman Hospitality as buy Jefferies said the real estate investment trust has a differentiated offering. \"Our positive view on RHP is based on unique hospitality assets within the long-booking-window group market, with post-COVID recovery room and incremental asset growth likely.\" Raymond James upgrades Masimo to outperform from market perform The firm said the health technology story looks like a \"cleaner business.\" \"While fully acknowledging the strong recent move in the stock, estimates are expected to trend higher and the MASI story is much cleaner without Consumer, which makes it tougher for us to stay neutral.\" Citi reiterates GE Healthcare as buy The firm said the company remains a top pick and is bullish heading into analyst day in late November. \" GEHC will host an Analyst Day on November 21, its first since the IPO: the last event was in December 2022, when as part of General Electric the goal was to educate investors about the company.\" Barclays initiates Tencent Music Entertainment as overweight Barclays said the China music company is best positioned. \"The combination of a market with little competition, management's track record of adaption and execution, and new growth path ahead make TME one of the best positioned Chinese Internet companies in their respective fields.\" Deutsche Bank reiterates Spotify as buy Deutsche said it's bullish heading into the streaming company's earnings report on November 12. \"Since the 2Q print, SPOT has outperformed the market, up 15% vs the S & P 500 at +4%. Gross Margins remain in focus as 3Q will have a near full-quarter impact from the US audiobook price increases, which we currently expect to drive ~80bps q/q premium GM expansion in 3Q, after seeing a 120bps q/q uplift in 2Q24.\" Deutsche Bank upgrades Celanese to buy from hold Deutsche said shares of the chemical supplier are attractive following an earnings selloff. \"We are upgrading Celanese to Buy from Hold following the shares' 26% decline post its Q3 earnings release.\" Wells Fargo reiterates Nike and Burlington top ideas The firm named a slew of retail stocks that it says are the best way to play a tough macro. \"Namely, BURL remains our Top Pick (best way to play off-price 'offense'), GAP (turnaround story working with cheap valuation),TPR (story set to inflect as visibility increases post CPRI outcome), NKE (culture is shifting, numbers reset, risk/reward compelling) and VSCO.\" Oppenheimer reiterates Instacart as outperform Oppenheimer said it's bullish heading into Instacart earnings next week. \"Increasing target to $55 (was $48) and reiterating Outperform ahead of 3Q earnings (11/12), despite stock near all-time highs.\" JPMorgan downgrades Super Micro to underweight from neutral JPMorgan downgraded the stock following earnings citing too much regulatory uncertainty. \"We are downgrading shares of Super Micro to Underweight even following a positive update shared by the company in relation to opinion of the Special Committee, led by the following risk factors that are leading us to expect more uncertainty around both the regulatory filings as well as business fundamentals...\" TD Cowen downgrades Brown-Forman to hold from buy TD Cowen said it sees too many negative revisions for the alcohol and beverage company. \"We downgrade BFB to Hold and reduce our PT to $48. We believe shares will be rangebound over the medium-term as trends for BFB and the category remain weak.\" Needham reiterates Amazon as buy Needham said it thinks the e-commerce giant should be valued as a Services company. \"In 3Q24, we believe nearly 60% of AMZN's revs and 90% of its operating income (OI) came from Services. Therefore, we argue that AMZN should be valued as a Services company, not an eCommerce company.\" UBS reiterates Ferrari as buy UBS called the luxury vehicle company \"one of the most attractive organic growth stories.\" \"Q3 was widely expected to be the weakest quarter for Ferrari in 2024, primarily due to temporary headwinds, yet the company's performance was still ahead of many peers in Luxury as well as Autos sectors.\" Barclays initiates Vipshop as overweight Barclays said it's bullish on the China e-commerce company. \" Vipshop's focused branded sales model differentiates it in the competitive Chinese ecommerce market.\" Mizuho adds Nvidia to its top ideas list in November The firm said it's sticking with the stock and sees more upside. \"We see NVDA remaining the leader in the AI training and inference chips for Data Center applications (we estimate > 95% share), which we believe is growing at a 74% CAGR to > $400B by 2027E.\" Monness Crespi Hardt upgrades Snowflake to buy from hold The firm said Snowflake is well positioned for AI. \"Unsurprising to us, the gen AI propaganda of 2023 has proven to be a revenue illusion for the software complex in 2024; however, we believe the industry, and Snowflake, will begin to derive incremental activity from this long-term secular trend over the next 12-18 months.\" Bank of America downgrades Five Below to underperform from neutral Bank of America said it sees \"no clear path to a turnaround with tariffs looming.\" \"We are downgrading FIVE to Underperform as we do not see a clear path to a turnaround in comps and expect continued margin deleverage on lower sales and incremental tariff costs.\"\n",

The analyst thinks the electric vehicle maker can pass the $1 trillion market cap threshold if the Republican nominee comes out on top in the U.S. presidential election. \"It's a dream scenario for any Tesla bull,\" he said on CNBC's \"Your Money Your Vote\" early Wednesday. \"This could ultimately add $40 to $50 per share to Tesla's stock right off the bat, and we could now be talking about a $1 trillion [or] $1.5 trillion market cap for Tesla.\" Tesla, which is up just 1% for the year, has a market cap of $807.1 billion through Tuesday's close.

TSLA YTD mountain TSLA, year-to-date Ives cited less regulation under a potential Trump administration as a key tailwind for Tesla, as he believes that Trump ending a tax credit for electric vehicles may actually be a positive for the company in terms of scale and scope.

He sees the Cybercab, an autonomous vehicle unveiled by Tesla recently, getting \"pulled forward\" by about one year. Musk has said he hopes to be producing the vehicle by 2027 . \"Ultimately, I think Tesla is the most undervalued AI name in the market,\" he also said. \"This is just more and more going to unlock that opportunity for Tesla and Musk.\" His bullish stance comes as Wall Street analysts are generally split on the stock.

      "Three global alcoholic beverage makers are likely to see a \"negative impact\" from a Republican victory in the U.S. election due to the potential for trade tariffs, according to TD Cowen analysts. The investment bank, a subsidiary of Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank, said that Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman and Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands are \"most negatively exposed\" to the introduction of higher tariffs on trade , a key policy proposed by Donald Trump. Guinness maker Diageo would be one of the companies to be impacted by a \"smaller degree,\" according to the bank's analysts. Brown-Forman \"In the event of a Republican victory, we see a high likelihood of the EU reinstating tariffs on American whiskey,\" said TD Cowen's Robert Moskow in a note to clients on Nov. 5, just before polls closed in the U.S. During Trump's presidency in 2018, the European Union hit American whiskey with 25% import taxes to retaliate against Trump's tariffs on European steel and aluminum imports. These tariff measures were relaxed by the EU in early 2022, but are expected to be reinstated and doubled to 50% in 2025. BF.B 5Y line Constellation Brands The brewer behind Corona produces its beers exclusively in Mexico and would be faced with a \"significant challenge\" if Trump introduced tariffs on goods from Mexico. However, the company also sources key ingredients, such as corn and barley, from American farmers, which might deflect some of the pressures the company may face. \"While there may be some government goodwill afforded to the company due to its reliance on U.S. farmers, we believe that a tariff on Mexico would negatively impact the company's margin structure and disrupt its supply chain,\" said the bank's analysts. \"That said, the headwinds would be partially offset by devaluation of the Mexican peso, given that approximately 25% of the company's [cost of goods sold] is peso-denominated.\" STZ 5Y line Diageo Tariffs could \"hit multiple areas of the business\" at Diageo, TD Cowen analysts said. The company, which makes the Don Julio tequilas in Mexico, has nearly a quarter of its total sales in the U.S. reliant on tariff free trade at the southern border. \"We would expect Diageo to pass a portion of the 25% potential tariff along to the consumer, however with the spirits category still weak, the elasticity impact of a large tariff-related price increase could be substantial,\" the analysts said.

      "As the results of one of the most hotly contested elections in the U.S. come in, investors are scrambling to position for the most likely outcome. But Shelby McFaddin, senior analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management, is looking beyond the end result. She expects volatility this week, but a \"limited impact on long-term investments as markets await real policy implications.\" Any bets made before the results are final are \"pure speculation,\" she told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Nov. 5. \"Either potential administrations would bring an increase in infrastructure spending and inflation remains a concern.\" Kenny Polcari of Slatestone Wealth agrees that politics does \"not price stocks in the long term.\" \"[Elections] create short-term chaos, which then creates opportunities for a long-term investor. But don't go building your portfolio based around who you think is going to live in the White House,\" the chief market strategist at the U.S.-based wealth management firm told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Nov. 5. Investors are also paying close attention to which party takes control of Congress , as a division of power in Washington could make it harder for either presidential candidate to enforce their policies. A clean sweep by either Republicans or Democrats, on the other hand, could result in big changes to spending or tax policy. 'Success story' Looking past the election result, McFaddin named three stocks she likes right now, including shipping and parcel delivery giant United Parcel Service . Calling the company \"really interesting,\" the analyst said it has \"been a little bit of a success story,\" with a rebound in earnings and revenue. UPS' third-quarter results surpassed Wall Street's expectations as volumes bounced back following a post-lockdown slump. The company also increased its full-year operating margin forecast to 9.6%. Aside from its improved financials, McFaddin likes UPS' management team who have done \"everything that they could to deliver on margins, even when they really could not control everything about their top line.\" \"That's just been one of our favorite management stories ... It's not necessarily the world's fastest grower, but it is a really reliable company with really strong management,\" she added. Shares in UPS are down around 14.9% year to date and analysts are divided on the company. Some 15 give it a buy or overweight rating, while 14 give it a hold or sell rating and three have a sell call, according to FactSet data. The analysts' average target price on the stock is $149.96, giving it 12% upside potential. CRH Building materials company CRH is another \"really interesting pick\" for McFaddin, who expects it to benefit from an increase in infrastructure spending over the next decade. She also sees the company benefiting from the laying of asphalt and concrete to build communities as more people move out of coastal areas. \"Recent weather disasters further highlight the urgent need for infrastructure rebuilding, underscoring the importance of investing in resilient infrastructure over the next decade,\" McFaddin added in notes to CNBC. Shares in CRH are up around 40% year-to-date. Of 25 analysts covering the stock, 21 give it a buy or overweight rating, three have a hold rating, while one has an underweight call, according to FactSet data. The analysts have an average price target of $104.02 for the stock, giving it 7.3% upside potential. Mastercard Also on McFaddin's radar is payments giant Mastercard . \"Mastercard is crucial to payment infrastructure ... In tough market conditions, major players have flexibility,\" the analyst wrote in notes to CNBC. McFaddin also likes that the stock is \"well-insulated\" from a weakening in consumer spending, especially on big-ticket items. Her bullish call comes despite the stock's current valuation, trading at almost 35 times forward earnings. Shares in Mastercard are up around 18.5% year-to-date. Of 39 analysts covering the stock, 31 give it a buy or overweight rating, while the remaining eight have a hold rating, according to FactSet data. The analysts have an average price target of $558.19 for the stock, giving it 10.4% upside potential. — CNBC's Sawdah\n",

      "\n",
      "A credit card's welcome bonus is often the most valuable benefit. However, it's only a one-time perk, so you'll want to carefully consider everything else the card offers before applying. As you're analyzing intro bonus offers, it's important to pay attention to two factors: Bonus value and requirements. Bonus value For certain types of cards, it's simple to estimate the bonus value. For example, a cash bonus of $500 is worth $500, but how much are 50,000 points or miles worth? The answer depends on the type of rewards and how you intend to use them: Hotel points or airline miles: Only redeemable within the specific program, limiting your options\n",
      "\n",
      "Only redeemable within the specific program, limiting your options Transferrable points: These can typically be moved to many different airlines or hotels, which could provide you with more choices. This added flexibility can increase the value of flexible rewards, so 50,000 transferrable points are generally worth more than 50,000 hotel points. Bonus requirements If you're approved for a card, you'll still need to meet the spending requirement before you're awarded any bonus points, miles or cash. To ensure you can hit the spending threshold without overspending, look at your credit card statement for the past few months or the year. This should give you a good idea of how much you can expect to spend on your new card. If you usually spend $1,500 on your credit card(s) each month, then any card with a spending requirement of $4,500 or less within three months should be achievable. You can also plan your credit card application around bigger, but less frequent expenses. If you're paying your annual insurance premiums or booking lodging for your yearly vacation, it might make sense to apply for a card beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit card welcome bonus pros and cons\n",
      "\n",
      "Card credit intro bonuses can help you collect loads of miles, points or other rewards. However, these are one-time bonuses, and you need to look at a card's benefits and perks to get the full picture of whether it's a worthy addition to your wallet. Welcome bonuses also typically have spending requirements that need to be met within a certain timeframe and these requirements aren't always easy to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros Welcome bonuses can be exceptionally valuable, even when factoring in the spending requirement. The best offers may provide 10X to 20X points per dollar on the spending you need to make to earn the bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intro bonuses allow you to quickly earn enough rewards to book more valuable redemptions, such as business-class flights or luxury hotels that typically have higher point or mile requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons A card's welcome bonus could entice you to spend more than you otherwise would have. In this scenario, you may end up paying interest if you can't afford to pay off the balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intro bonuses are one-off card benefits, so you need to make sure the card's ongoing perks are worth it or offset the annual fee (if there is one).\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What is a credit card sign-up bonus? A credit card sign-up bonus is an incentive to entice consumers to open a new credit card and make purchases with the card. You typically need to spend a certain amount within a specified period to earn the bonus. How do credit card sign-up bonuses work? Credit card sign-up bonuses are typically one-time offers you can qualify for when you open a new card. These rewards often come in the form of cashback, points or miles, and generally require spending a certain amount of money with that card within the first few months of account opening. The spending thresholds vary but generally range from $500 to $5,000. Are credit card sign-up bonus offers worth it? Credit card sign-up bonuses can be worth it as they can add hundreds of dollars (or sometimes even over a thousand dollars) back to your wallet and are generally non-taxable since you had to spend money to earn them. However, you should only pursue a welcome bonus if you can meet the spending requirement without overspending or stretching yourself too thin. You don't want to carry a balance just to earn a bonus since the interest charges could outweigh the value of any rewards you earn. How many credit card sign-up bonuses can you earn? Some card issuers like American Express limit the number of sign-up bonuses you can earn for a card to once per lifetime, while others may allow you to earn a sign-up bonus multiple times, but may make you wait a certain period of time before being eligible again. What sign-up bonuses are the easiest to get? Cashback cards generally have sign-up bonuses that are easier to earn. What is the best credit card sign-up bonus? While the best credit card sign-up bonus will depend on the individual, travel rewards cards like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and The Platinum Card® from American Express currently offer some of the largest welcome bonuses. Are credit card sign-up bonuses taxed? Credit card sign-up bonuses are typically not considered taxable income because they usually have a spending requirement, which makes them a form of rebate or discount.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine which cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S. and offer welcome bonuses. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back.

      "How to choose a credit card for building credit\n",
      "\n",
      "Deciding which credit-building card is best for you depends heavily on your situation and how you plan to use the card. Know what cards you're eligible for Your credit score goes a long way in determining what cards you can qualify for. If you're looking to boost your credit score from average to excellent to increase your approval odds for a home loan, an unsecured credit card could work for you. Credit cards for average credit may also have rewards and other benefits for you to take advantage of. If you're new to credit or recovering from bankruptcy, you may need to start with a secured credit card. Some credit cards offer pre-approval or pre-qualification, which doesn't guarantee you'll be approved for a card, but it can save you from applying for a card you're likely to be rejected for. In some situations, it may make sense to apply for a card issued by the bank where you have checking or savings accounts because that could boost your approval odds. Understand what matters when building credit By making on-time payments, credit cards allow you to slowly rebuild your credit score or fill out your credit report. When you keep your credit card balance low, or ideally, pay it off fully each month, this also helps boost your credit score. So building good financial habits is more important than finding the most rewarding credit card. When you want to use a credit card to establish your credit history, think of rewards as icing on the cake. Don't look for lucrative welcome bonuses or overspending to earn rewards on unlock benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to build credit with a credit card\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different types of credit scoring models, such as FICO Score and VantageScore, but the most popular scores use the information on your credit report. They typically use the information from the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. By opening a credit card, you're adding to your credit profile. However, how you use the credit card is what matters the most. Pay your monthly bill on time Your payment history is a huge part of your credit score. So it's important to pay your credit card bill on time and consistently. As these payments are documented in your credit report, your credit score is more likely to improve over time. Keep your balance low Your total debt also factors heavily into how your credit score is calculated. Having less debt and using a smaller percentage of your available credit (keeping a low credit utilization ratio) will have a positive impact on your credit score. This makes having a budget in place an important part of building credit. It can be easy to overspend with a credit card and if you find yourself in this situation, it could hurt your credit instead of help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of cards to look for if you want to build credit\n",
      "\n",
      "Rewards and travel benefits shouldn't be the priority when building credit. Rather, you should use a credit-building card to establish responsible credit habits. Once you're in a situation where you can consistently pay off your credit cards in full and on time, then you're ready to consider credit cards with larger welcome bonuses and useful benefits. Secured credit cards Secured credit cards require an upfront deposit and your credit limit is based on that deposit. Secured credit cards like the Discover it® Secured Credit Card are less risky for card issuers and you can possibly qualify for secured cards with no credit history or if you have a weak credit score. Unsecured credit cards do not require a security deposit and have a credit limit based on your income, credit history and other factors. There are unsecured credit cards available to those with average or fair credit, but in general, if you have no credit or bad credit, an unsecured credit card will be your best option for moving your credit score forward. Student credit cards If you're interested in opening your first credit card, are over 18 years old and are enrolled in an eligible college, consider a student credit card like the Discover it® Student Cash Back. These cards are designed with students in mind and are often available even if you don't have a credit history. Many of these cards also don't require a security deposit and some even offer rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does it mean to build your credit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your credit score is based on the information in your credit report. To build your credit you need activity, like credit card and loan payments, to be reported to credit bureaus. Your credit score is generally based on factors such as payment history, the age of your accounts and total debt. When you open a credit card and pay the balance on time consistently, this improves your credit score and is a signal to creditors that you're a reliable borrower. However, having a credit card can work both ways. If you miss payments or are late paying, that harms your credit score. Also, if you pay on time, but accumulate debt that can hurt your credit score. Overall, the best way to build credit is to have a long history of positive activity (i.e. paying on time) with creditors such as banks and credit unions.\n",

      "Tips for building credit\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no set formula for building credit. Instead, your habits, over time, will move your credit score in one direction or another. However, there are a few tips that can help you get things headed in the right direction. Understand how credit scores work Knowing what goes into your credit score is key to building a healthy credit profile. While there are multiple types of credit scores, the most popular credit scoring models are largely based on factors such as: Payment history\n",

      "\n",
      "Types of credit\n",
      "\n",
      "Age of accounts Each factor is weighted differently, and your payment history and debt typically are more important. It's important to develop the habit of paying bills on time and creating a plan to stay out of debt or pay down your existing debt if you want to improve your credit score. Get added as an authorized user If your lack of credit history is preventing you from getting approved for a credit card or a car loan, it might make sense to get added as an authorized user on someone else's account. When you're added as an authorized user, the credit history of that account could be added to your credit report. This can be a double-edged sword, so it only makes sense to go this route with someone with a history of paying their credit cards on time and in full. Monitor your credit A credit monitoring service can help you maintain an error-free credit report by alerting you when anything changes on your credit report. There are free credit monitoring services that are useful, but if you want to cover all the credit bureaus you may want to opt for a more robust paid service. PrivacyGuard, named one of CNBC Select's best credit monitoring services, provides the ability to monitor all three major credit bureaus and offers identity protection.\n",

      "FAQs Why is building credit important? Building a good credit score is necessary for many major financial moves, including taking out a mortgage, opening a credit card, getting car insurance and sometimes even landing your dream job. If you don't have a good or excellent credit score, you may not get approved for a certain financial product or may pay higher interest rates. What are the benefits of building credit? Building credit has many benefits because nearly every facet of your financial life is impacted by the strength of your credit score. Building a good credit score helps improve your approval odds for financial products, helps you qualify for lower interest rates and better terms and allows you to to benefit from robust credit card benefits. Can I get approved for a credit card with no credit history? It is possible to sign up for a credit card without having a credit history. It's generally easier to get approved for secured credit cards or starter credit cards, which are designed especially for those who are beginning to build their credit. How do I improve my credit score? The best way to improve your credit score is by consistently practicing responsible credit behavior, such as paying your bills on time every month and limiting your credit utilization ratio. Do authorized users build credit? Becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit card is a great way to build credit. So long as the primary cardholder has good (670 to 799) or excellent credit (800 to 850), it can be relatively low-risk and allows you to build or boost your credit score. However, there are also instances where being an authorized user can harm your credit score, such as if the primary account holder misses a payment.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine which cards offer the best value for rebuilding credit CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back. When choosing the best credit cards for rebuilding credit, we focused on cards that are available to consumers with lower credit scores or those with no credit history. While rewards and other benefits were also factored into our decisions, these were secondary considerations.

      "What are the benefits of refinancing debt?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you carry a balance on a credit card (or multiple cards) with a high APR, you might want to consider debt refinancing. Simply put, you take out a new loan to pay off old debt, then pay back the new debt according to agreed-upon terms. It makes sense to refinance if you can't afford your current bill payments and need to find a lower monthly plan, or if your credit score is good enough to qualify you for a lower APR, which makes paying off the debt cheaper. For example, say you have a $10,000 balance on your credit card that charges interest at a rate of 24.99% APR. Assuming you can afford to make $400 monthly payments, it would take about three years to pay your balance off entirely. You'll also pay about $4,000 in interest, according to Experian's debt payoff calculator. On the other hand, transferring that debt to a personal loan with a 9% APR, can save you more than $3,000. Experian's calculator estimates with the same monthly payment ($400) and the lower APR, you can pay off the balance in 22 months and only pay $875 in interest charges overall. When you apply for a personal loan, you should consider the APR and the loan's term, or the length of time it will take you to pay it off. Make sure the monthly loan repayment amount fits into your budget, so you're able to comfortably pay off the loan and get your debt under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can debt refinancing hurt your credit score?\n",
      "\n",
      "At its best, debt refinancing can boost your credit score by making your monthly payments more affordable and motivating you to pay off your balances. But they aren't entirely risk-free. Personal loan applications require a credit check, so you'll want to make sure you know your credit score before you apply. There's no direct penalty for getting denied a loan, but having too many applications on your credit record could be a red flag to future lenders. For debt refinancing to work, you have to \"plan your work and work your plan,\" so to speak. It helps to be honest about your money habits and the overall state of your personal finances before taking on any loan. Personal loans deliver cash directly to your bank account, making it easy to stay in debt if you're not careful. If you have concerns, opt for a loan that pays your creditors directly so that there's no opportunity for you to overspend. And before you agree to a new loan, make sure you have room in your budget to pay it back on time and in full according to the terms. A late payment on your personal loan can hurt your credit score just like if you miss a credit card bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a good interest rate on a personal loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most personal loans come with fixed-rate APRs, so your monthly payment stays the same for the loan's lifetime. In a few cases, you can take out a variable-rate personal loan. If you go that route, make sure you're comfortable with your monthly payments changing if rates go up or down. Personal loan APRs average 9.65%, according to the Fed's most recent data. Meanwhile, the average credit card interest rate is around 16.28%. When considering whether to invest or pay off debt, consider that the average rate of return in the stock market tends to be above 5% when adjusted for inflation. So if you can find a personal loan with interest rates would be below 5%, you can slowly pay off your debt while also investing because you know your investments could still earn more than you're paying in interest. However, it's not always easy to qualify for personal loans with interest rates lower than 5% APR. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do personal loans work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you're approved for a personal loan, the cash is usually delivered directly to your checking account. However, if you opt for a debt consolidation/refinancing loan, you can sometimes have your lender pay your credit card accounts directly. Any extra cash leftover will be deposited into your bank account or returned to the lender. Most loan terms range anywhere from six months to seven years. The longer the term, the lower your monthly payments will be, but they usually also have higher interest rates. It's best to elect for the shortest term you can afford. When deciding on a loan term, consider how much you will end up paying in interest overall. Your monthly loan bill will include your installment payment plus interest charges. If you think you may want to pay off the loan earlier than planned, be sure to check if the lender charges an early payoff or prepayment penalty. Sometimes lenders charge a fee if you make extra payments to pay your debt down quicker, since they are losing out on that prospective interest. The fee could be a flat rate, a percentage of your loan amount or the rest of the interest you would have owed them. Once you receive the money from your loan, you have to pay back the lender in monthly installments, usually starting within 30 days. When your personal loan is paid off, the credit line is closed and you no longer have access to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is my personal loan rate decided?\n",
      "\n",
      "As you shop for a low-interest loan or credit card, remember that banks are looking for reliable borrowers who make timely payments. Financial institutions will look at your credit score, income, payment history and, in some cases, cash reserves when deciding what APR to give you. To get approved for any kind of credit product (credit card, loan, mortgage, etc.), you'll first submit an application and agree to let the lender pull your credit report. This helps lenders understand how much debt you owe, what your current monthly payments are and how much additional debt you have the capacity to take on. Once you submit your application, you may be approved for a variety of loan options. Each will have a different length of time to pay the loan back (your term) and a different interest rate. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. Generally, loans with longer terms have higher interest rates than loans you bay back over a shorter period of time.\n",

      "Our methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine which personal loans are the best for refinancing debt, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

      "We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more. *Your LightStream loan terms, including APR, may differ based on loan purpose, amount, term length, and your credit profile. Excellent credit is required to qualify for lowest rates. Rate is quoted with AutoPay discount. AutoPay discount is only available prior to loan funding. Rates without AutoPay are 0.50% points higher. Subject to credit approval. Conditions and limitations apply. Advertised rates and terms are subject to change without notice. Payment example: Monthly payments for a $10,000 loan at 7.99% APR with a term of three years would result in 36 monthly payments of $313.32.\n",

Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees.

Eligible borrowers Must reside in a state where SoFi is authorized to lend and must be employed, have sufficient income from other sources, or have an offer of employment to start within the next 90 days.

      "\n",
      "Loans that can be disbursed as soon as the same business day as approval (or even one business day later) are typically considered quick loans. Most lenders can provide funding in a few days, usually 3–5 business days after approval. However, some lenders who disburse funds through a mailed check can take longer to get you the loan proceeds — usually closer to a week. That's why a quick loan is the ideal solution for someone who wants (or needs) their money ASAP.\n",

      "What are the pros and cons of quick personal loans?\n",

      "Pros No collateral required: Personal loans generally don't require you to secure the loan with an asset. This is good news since you won't be at risk of losing something valuable, like your car, if you default on the loan. However, there will still be implications to your credit score if you fail to repay your loan, as with any other form of credit.\n",

Though, it is possible to find lenders that don't charge these fees. Higher monthly payments: For the most part, credit cards require a low minimum monthly payment (though, experts advise paying off your balance in full each month). With personal loans, though, your monthly payment is often higher than that of credit cards even if you have a long loan term. Granted, you're able to borrow higher amounts with a personal loan than you would with a credit card.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you apply for a quick loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you should compare different quick loans. Many lenders will let you check (for free) on their websites what interest rate you'll likely receive with them. This lets you eliminate the high-rate options and hone in on your preferred lender. Once you've picked your lender, you then apply for a loan. This will trigger a hard inquiry on your credit history, which lowers your score a little, so don't apply for more than one loan if you can help it. The application usually requires you to submit personal information like your address, social security number and the loan purpose. The best way to receive a loan quickly is to ensure all information is accurate and complete. Errors or failure to submit complete information could delay the approval process.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the credit requirements for a quick loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit requirements depend on the lender. Most lenders want to see good-to-excellent credit, but a handful of lenders cater to borrowers with fair or poor credit. Be sure to double-check with the lender before applying.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What is a personal loan? A personal loan is a type of installment credit that allows borrowers to receive a one-time lump sum of cash. Borrowers must then pay back that amount plus interest in regular, monthly installments over the loan's term. How do you apply for a personal loan? When applying for a personal loan, you'll need to provide some basic pieces of information, which can include your address, social security number and date of birth, among others. You may also be required to submit pay stubs as proof of income. Some lenders may also require your bank account information. An application can typically be submitted online or in person if the lender has physical branches that you can visit. How do you get a personal loan with bad credit? Some lenders offer personal loans that cater to borrowers with lower credit scores, and may allow borrowers with bad credit to apply with co-borrowers. It's always advised to try to improve your credit score before applying for any form of credit since it can be difficult to qualify with lower credit scores. Additionally, lower credit scores tend to be subject to higher interest rates. What is an unsecured personal loan? An unsecured loan is a form of credit that doesn't require you to put up collateral that can be used to settle your balance if you default on the loan. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.\n",

      "To determine which personal loans are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with no origination or signup fees, fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness.

For those looking to open an account at a bank with the most opportunity for in-person access, Wells Fargo is your best choice. Wells Fargo offers two different savings accounts: the basic Way2Save® Savings and the elevated Platinum Savings. CNBC Select chose Way2Save as the better savings account option because it has a lower minimum daily balance requirement to avoid the monthly service fee ($5 per month for Way2Save and $12 per month for Platinum). To avoid these fees, account holders must either maintain a $300 minimum daily balance or set up their choice of automatic transfers from their checking to their savings: $25 in total, $1 each business day per month or at least one Save As You Go® transfer. With Save As You Go, it's easy to set aside cash. Wells Fargo automatically transfers $1 of a customer's funds from their linked Wells Fargo checking account to their Way2Save account for each qualifying transaction that is a non-recurring debit card purchase or online bill payment using Wells Fargo Online® Bill Pay. To accelerate completing your savings goals, you can set up additional automatic transfers from your checking account each month. There is a $25 minimum opening deposit for this savings account, and those who link a Wells Fargo checking account can opt for overdraft protection. The APY on this account is currently 0.15%.\n",

      "Who's this for? If you are looking for a broad network of ATMs to avoid any out-of-network fees and want a chance to earn a slightly higher APY, consider the savings accounts offered by Chase. Chase Bank has nearly 4,900 branches and 16,000 ATMs. Like Wells Fargo, Chase offers two brick-and-mortar savings accounts: the standard Chase Savings℠ and the Chase Premier Savings℠. The latter is stronger because you can earn better interest rates (what Chase calls \"relationship rates\") on higher balances by linking your savings to a Chase Premier Plus Checking℠ or Chase Sapphire℠ Banking and making at least five transactions in a month using your linked checking account. If you don't link your Chase Premier Savings account to a Chase checking account, the APY is 0.01%. But the APY creeps up slightly if you do have a linked account. For example, you can earn 0.02% APY if you also have a Premier Plus Checking or Chase Sapphire Banking account. By linking to a checking account, you also avoid the monthly $25 service fee that comes with the Chase Premier Savings. Otherwise, there's a daily minimum balance of $15,000 required. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. If you choose to link a Chase Sapphire Banking account, you can take advantage of Sapphire℠ Banking perks, which include special access to sports and entertainment events and early ticket sales. Chase also has an automatic savings program where customers can get help reaching their set savings goals in the bank's mobile app. There is a $5 savings withdrawal limit fee when you make over six withdrawals in a month, including those made at a branch or at an ATM. This fee is waived with a balance of $15,000 or more in the account at the time of withdrawal.\n",

Potential savers can open an account with a $25 minimum deposit. The monthly maintenance fee is $4 a month. The fee is waived for account holders who have a $300 minimum daily balance, a $1,000 average monthly collected balance or are under 18. The APY offered is 0.01% on all balances, and you can take advantage of overdraft protection when linking your savings account to your U.S. Bank checking account.\n",

Citi stands out for offering a higher APY than its brick-and-mortar competitors with a 3.85% APY. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. Customers can avoid paying the low monthly fee by maintaining a minimum daily balance of at least $500 or linking their savings account to their checking account and either making one enhanced direct deposit and one qualifying bill payment per statement period or maintaining a $1,500 average monthly collected balance.\n",

      "Who's this for? PNC Bank is a large brick-and-mortar bank with approximately 2,300 branch locations and nearly 18,000 PNC and PNC Partner ATMs. It stands out on our list for its savings account option called Virtual Wallet®, which uses innovative online tools to make it easy to see how you're managing your money day to day. The account is best for those who want to do all their banking in one place as it rewards you for combining your savings and checking into one. New account holders can earn a welcome bonus of up to $400 depending on what type of Virtual Wallet they open. The three choices include Virtual Wallet, Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend and Virtual Wallet with Performance Select. The simple Virtual Wallet has basic account features while the two other options offer more premium rewards. For those enrolled in school, there is also a Virtual Wallet Student option. All of the above Virtual Wallet options include individual accounts that work together: Spend, Reserve and Growth. Spend is your everyday checking account, Reserve your interest-bearing checking account / primary overdraft protection account and Growth is your long-term savings account / secondary overdraft protection account. Higher \"relationship\" interest rates are available on your Growth savings account. The monthly service charges range from $7 to $25, depending on the type of Virtual Wallet you have and can be waived depending on minimum balances in your Spend + Reserve checking accounts (required balances and minimum deposits vary according to the type of Virtual Wallet you have). Virtual Wallet account holders can make free transactions at approximately 9,000 PNC-owned ATMs, and if you end up using a non-PNC ATM, some fees are reimbursed. Through the PNC Purchase Payback® program, customers can also earn cash back or points on purchases made using their PNC Bank Visa® Debit Card which is automatically issued when they sign up for Virtual Wallet. The customized rewards program has offers available from participating merchants depending on your shopping habits. If you're looking for a more straightforward account, PNC Bank also offers a Standard Savings Account. For current APY information, call 1-888-PNC-BANK (1-888-762-2265).\n",

      "Our methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine which brick-and-mortar savings accounts offer the most convenience, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by the largest national banks and credit unions. We narrowed down our ranking by only considering those savings accounts that come from brick-and-mortar banks with broad availability, offering access to at least 700 physical branches and over 4,000 non-fee ATMs in the U.S. While the accounts we chose in this article are from the largest banks, we compared each savings account on a range of features, including its fees, opportunities to earn higher interest rates, customer service and any other special offerings or programs. We also considered factors such as insurance policies, users' deposit options, other savings accounts being offered by the same bank and customer reviews when available. All of the accounts included on this list are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Note that the interest rates and fee structures for brick-and-mortar savings accounts are subject to change without notice. Product and feature availability vary by market so they may not be offered depending on where you live. Most brick-and-mortar banks require you to enter your zip code online for the correct account offerings. Any return on your savings depends on the associated fees and the balance you have in your brick-and-mortar savings account. To open a savings account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank.

      "FAQs What is considered a low down payment? For a conventional mortgage, lenders typically approve qualified borrowers with a down payment of 5% or more. Anything less than that is considered a low down payment. What are some common types of low-down-payment mortgages? FHA loans, VA loans and USDA loans are all popular types of low-down-payment mortgages insured by government agencies, each with its own eligibility requirements. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back HomeReady, Home Possible and HomeOne mortgages. Many banks have proprietary mortgages with low down payments: With Rocket Mortgage's Rocket ONE+ loan, for example, you can put as little as 1% down without private mortgage insurance. Do I have to put down 20% to buy a home? The median down payment for first-time homebuyers between July 2022 and June 2023 was 8%, according to the National Association of Realtors. Putting less than 20% down, however, will likely mean you'll have to pay private mortgage insurance.\n",

When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan.

Minimum down payment: Although minimum down payment amounts depend on the type of loan a borrower applies for, we noted lenders that offer additional specialty loans that come with a lower minimum down payment amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for no down payment, affordability, no lender fees, low-income borrowers, VA loans, USDA loans and online lenders. Rates and fee structures advertised for mortgages fluctuate in accordance with the Federal Reserve rate. However, once you accept your mortgage agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan, unless you choose to refinance your mortgage at a later date for a potentially lower APR. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history, creditworthiness, debt-to-income ratio and the desired loan term. To take out a mortgage, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "\n",
      "Guaranteed by the Department of Veteran Affairs, VA loans are zero-down mortgages available to active service members, veterans and some surviving spouses. Because they're backed by the government, they usually have lower interest rates than conventional mortgages and do not require private mortgage insurance. The VA doesn't set credit or income requirements, so lenders tend to have more flexible requirements, too. Instead of mortgage insurance, there is a one-time funding fee that is dependent on how much of a down payment you make:\n",

      "USDA loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and, like VA loans, do not require a down payment or private mortgage insurance. Interest rates on USDA loans are also typically lower than those for conventional loans and credit requirements are also more lenient. Unlike VA loans, however, only borrowers who earn no more than 115% of the area median income are eligible for USDA loans. In addition, the loan can only be put toward a property in a specific USDA-approved rural or suburban area. (The USDA provides an eligibility map that indicates the eligible areas.) The free structure for a USDA loan is also slightly different: Instead of private mortgage insurance, borrowers pay an upfront guarantee fee an annual fee.\n",

      "Here are some of the most common types of mortgages you can apply for. Conventional mortgage The most common type of home loan, a conventional mortgage is offered by a private lender, such as a bank or credit union. Conventional loans typically require a down payment between 5% and 20%. FHA loan An FHA loan is still issued by a private lender but it's backed by the Federal Housing Administration. It usually requires a smaller down payment, typically 3.5% with a credit score of 580 or 10% with a score of 500. Jumbo loan A jumbo loan exceeds the limits on mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The conforming loan limit in 2024 is $766,550 in most parts of the U.S., although some high-price areas have limits up to $1,149,825. VA loan A VA loan is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. It may be issued by a partner bank or credit union or by the VA directly. These loans usually don't require a down payment but you must be an active service member, a veteran or a surviving spouse to be approved. USDA loan A USDA loan is backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and doesn't require a down payment or mortgage insurance. Applicants must meet income requirements, however, and the funds must be used to buy a home in a qualifying rural or suburban area.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What is an origination fee? An origination fee is charged by a mortgage lender to cover the cost of processing your loan. Origination fees may be lumped in with other upfront costs or waived in exchange for a higher interest rate or some other adjustment to your loan. How much are origination fees? Origination fees are commonly between 0.5% and 1% of your total loan amount. Some lenders charge a fixed amount, regardless of the size of the mortgage. What are lender fees? Lender fees is an umbrella term referring to the various charges associated with processing, approving and funding your loan. These are essentially a subset of closing costs and can include an origination fee, processing fee, underwriting fee and more. How much of a down payment do I need to make? In January 2024, the median down payment was 14.2%, according to data from the real estate data analysis firm ATTOM. You can get a conventional loan with as little as 3% down, however, but down payments of less than 20% often require private mortgage insurance, which can equal 0.50% of your total loan.\n",

      "To determine which mortgage lenders are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. mortgages offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you'll lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

We also opted for lenders with an online resource hub or advice center to help you educate yourself about the personal loan process and your finances. Minimum down payment: Although minimum down payment amounts depend on the type of loan a borrower applies for, we noted lenders that offer additional specialty loans that come with a lower minimum down payment amount. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for mortgages fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your mortgage agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan, unless you choose to refinance your mortgage at a later date for a potentially lower APR. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history, creditworthiness, debt-to-income ratio and the desired loan term. To take out a mortgage, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "\n",
      "The FICO credit score you need for approval depends on the type of mortgage. Conventional loan Conventional mortgages make up nearly three-quarters of all home loans. While lenders typically want to see a FICO score of 620 or better, there are options for borrowers with lower credit scores. Some will also consider nontraditional sources, like your banking history or on-time bill payments. FHA loans Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, FHA loans typically require a credit score of 500 and a 10% down payment. If you have a score of 580 or better, however, you can put down just 3.5%. VA loans Insured by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, VA loans are available to current and former service members and their spouses. While the VA doesn't set any credit score requirements, most lenders will want a 620. USDA loans A USDA loan is insured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is meant for low- to moderate-income borrowers buying a home in a designated rural or suburban area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The USDA doesn't set a minimum credit score requirement, though most lenders will want borrowers to have at least a 620. Jumbo loan A jumbo loan exceeds the limits for mortgages set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which means they can't be insured by FHA or bought by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Since that puts lenders at increased risk, they require a higher credit score — typically a 700.\n",

      "FAQs What credit score do I need to get a mortgage? Lenders typically want a credit score of 620 for a conventional loan. Because they're backed by the government, however, FHA loans are available to borrowers with scores as low as 500, though they will have to make a larger down payment. What credit score do I need to get the best mortgage rate? Lenders set their own rates and weigh credit scores differently. Typically, a FICO score of 760 will qualify you for the best rates. What is considered fair credit? Using FICO, a fair credit score is between 580 and 669. A fair score with VantageScore is between 601 and 660. Depending on where you fall in that range, you may meet the 620 score requirement lenders generally set for conventional loans — although you won't qualify for the best rates. How can I get a mortgage with bad credit? There are several mortgages with lower credit requirements, including VA and FHA loans, though they typically have income or service requirements. Another option is non-qualified mortgages, which don't meet the standards set by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They have laxer credit standards and can help borrowers who have been denied approval for a mortgage, have a nontraditional income stream or lack a credit history in the U.S.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: What is an adjustable-rate mortgage?\n",
      "\n",
      "An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has a rate that fluctuates over set intervals. During the initial repayment period, which is typically between five and ten years, your rate will stay the same. It will probably be lower than the rate you'd get with a fixed-rate mortgage. The trade-off, however, is that once the introductory phase ends, your rate adjusts every six or 12 months for the remainder of your term. Those rate changes are tied to market fluctuations, so if there's a drop in the benchmark index your lender selects when your ARM resets, your rate will go down. If there's an increase in that benchmark, however, that rate will go up. Your mortgage offer will detail your initial interest rate and the frequency of rate fluctuations. After closing, the only way to change these terms is to refinance to another ARM or to a fixed-rate mortgage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pro tip: Adjustable-rate mortgages are listed as fractions ARM terms are typically listed as a fraction — the top number is your fixed introductory period and the lower figure is the frequency at which the rate will fluctuate afterward. A 5/1 ARM, for example, has a set rate for five years and then it resets every year. A 5/6 ARM has a five-year fixed period, then adjusts every six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "FAQ How is an adjustable-rate mortgage different from a fixed-rate mortgage? Fixed-rate mortgages maintain the same interest rate over the loan's term. Adjustable-rate mortgages have a fixed rate for a set number of years. After that, the rate resets every six months or year. Who is an adjustable-rate mortgage good for? ARMs can benefit a variety of homebuyers, especially if you don't expect to stay in the house for more than a few years. If you have a 7/1 ARM and plan on selling within four years, you would benefit from the lower initial rate. If you expect rates to drop by the time your initial fixed phase expires, an ARM could also be a good idea. What is the main downside of an adjustable-rate mortgage? The biggest risk of an ARM is that, after the initial fixed-rate period expires, your rate could increase, pushing up your monthly mortgage payment.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: If you’re struggling with bad credit, you may stumble upon credit repair companies that boast the ability to clean up your credit report. These companies often target consumers with less-than-stellar credit and debt, hoping to acquire your business when you’re down on your luck. While signing up for a credit repair service can seem like a simple solution to your credit issues, these companies charge fees that can put you in more of a predicament. With just a little research and time out of your schedule, you may find you can easily dispute errors on your own at no cost. Before you work with a credit repair company, consider exactly what they offer and at what cost, as well as how you can clean up your credit for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is credit repair?\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit repair is the process of hiring a company to fix your bad credit through the removal of inaccurate, negative information on your credit reports. A credit repair company works on your behalf to remove this information by communicating with the credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) and/or financial companies, like your bank or a debt collector, to dispute the errors. There can be a lot of back and forth, but the end goal is to have negative information deleted from your credit file so your credit rating improves. Credit repair companies don't help you manage your money, which is a different service offered by credit counseling companies like the National Federation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) and the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA).\n",
      "\n",
      "How much does credit repair cost?\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit repair services aren’t free, but you won’t incur a fee until services are delivered. Fees are charged in one of two ways: monthly or per item removed from your credit report. Monthly subscriptions charge you for services provided during the previous 30 days, while the latter only charges you once info is removed from your credit file. The exact fees vary by service, but they can add up to hundreds or thousands of dollars every year.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to watch out for with credit repair companies\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit repair services aren’t always reliable or truthful. In fact, the CFPB found that more than half of people who submitted complaints about credit repair companies cited “fraud or scam.” Thankfully, there are consumer protections. If you opt to use a credit repair company, you’re protected under the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA), which regulates how these companies can operate. Some key points include: Consumers have three business days to cancel a contract without charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies can’t guarantee that they can remove information from your credit reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies can’t advise you to make false statements or change your identity to prevent the credit bureaus from associating information with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumers can’t be charged any fee for services that haven’t been fully rendered. Before signing up for any credit repair service, make sure they follow the CROA rules and look out for possible red flags, such as payments being demanded upfront or results that sound too good to be true. The CFPB lists more ways to avoid being misled by credit repair companies. And better yet, dispute any errors on your credit report on your own. There is no fee to clean up your credit and you’ll avoid misleading companies that may take advantage of your poor credit standing. Remember that even if you pay to have information removed from your credit report, there's no guarantee that it'll boost your credit score.\n",

      "Text: When you're ready to purchase a new coat from Neiman Marcus or a new iPhone from Apple, you have the option of financing the cost of your order over time with buy now, pay later. BNPL, also known as point-of-sale loans, is kind of like a modern-day layaway option: Consumers can buy items online or in-store, and then split up the cost of a purchase over a few weeks or a few months with regular installment payments rather than pay for the entire purchase up front. There are many BNPL providers that have emerged in the past few years, and consumers are increasingly flocking to them to finance everything from clothing to travel to workout equipment. As long as you make your payments on time, BNPL services can also help you build credit. With so many buy now, pay later options available to consumers, which provider is best? And for who? When compiling this round-up of popular BNPL options, CNBC Select looked at factors like APR, late fees, available merchants, whether a credit check is performed and if the provider reports to the credit bureaus to help you determine which provider is best for you.

      "Who's this for? Affirm is a good choice if you need a longer-term financing option with a 0% APR and no late fees. It offers POS loans ranging from one to 60 months with a limit of $25,000 per loan. Affirm is one of the few buy now, pay later providers that offer consumers long-term financing options with a 0% APR. However, the interest rate that you manage to secure on your loan depends on a variety of factors — including the purchase amount, length of payment term and the merchant — so you could end up with an APR as high as 36%. If you manage to secure a 0% loan, you also don't have to worry about late fees, which is rare. However, if you're late with payments, you might not able to get a loan from Affirm in the future, and it could potentially affect your credit score. Affirm uses a soft credit check when approving consumers for loans. It also reports some loans to the credit bureau Experian. It doesn't report 0% four-biweekly payment loans or 0% loans with a three-month repayment period. Your payment history, how much credit you've used, late payments and how long you've had the credit line open can affect your credit score. Affirm is a good choice because of its widespread availability: You can essentially use it on any purchase anywhere by using the Affirm website or the app. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of merchants that partner with Affirm, consumers are able to use the BNPL option at any retailer, either online or in-store, that aren't integrated with the company through Affirm's website or mobile app. Consumers will receive a single-use virtual card through the website or the app to pay for their purchases wherever they want. While the Better Business Bureau gives Affirm an A- rating (you can read more about the BBB rating process here), customer reviews are not so good. It has a 1.16/5 average rating based on over 700 customer reviews on the BBB website at the time of writing. The customer complaints range from not being able to get ahold of customer service to not being able to obtain a refund.\n",

      "Who's this for? Afterpay doesn't consider itself a POS loan provider because it doesn't charge interest on its loans, but it is commonly referred to as a buy now, pay later provider so we've included them in this round-up. Afterpay is best for people who can make their payments on time, need a short-term financing option with 0% interest and don't want the loan to affect their credit score. The company offers one product: a financing option with four installment payments due every two weeks over a six-week term. You make one down payment at the time of purchase (typically 25% of the order) and then pay the rest over six weeks. There isn't a limit on how much credit you can take out with Afterpay. Your credit limit depends on how long you've been an Afterpay customer, and whether you're making your payments on time and in full. A new user will likely have a lower limit than someone with a long history, so if it's your first time using Afterpay, you might have to stick with purchasing smaller-ticket items. The average Afterpay order is only $150. One major advantage of using Afterpay, over other POS providers, is that it doesn't affect your credit score at all — the company doesn't check your credit score, and it doesn't report any loan information to the credit bureaus. A major drawback of using Afterpay are the late fees. You'll be hit with an $8 fee, or 25% of your transaction, whichever is less, for each late payment. If you fail to make a payment, you won't have access to the platform to take out a new loan until you make a payment. When it comes to availability, Afterpay can be used at more than 100,000 merchants around the world including American Eagle, Bed Bath and Beyond and lululemon. Afterpay also offers some consumers the ability to use the app to make purchases at select retailers such as Nike, Kroger, Amazon and Macy's. Whenever you use the app, you'll be given a one-time virtual card. Much like the other POS providers in this round-up, Afterpay has poor customer service reviews on the Better Business Bureau website. It had a 1.17/5 average rating based on 398 customer reviews at the time of writing. Many of the customer complaints focused on canceled orders from the merchant or failure to receive a refund from Afterpay. BBB gives Afterpay a B rating based on its own rating system.\n",

Sezzle, a Minneapolis-based buy now, pay later provider, is best for people who want a short-term loan, no interest, no reporting to the credit bureaus and flexible payment dates. It's one of the few BNPL providers that allow customers to reschedule one payment per purchase. Sezzle offers short-term and long-term financing options. Its short-term financing option is a six-week loan where consumers make a down payment and bi-weekly installment payments on purchases up to $2,500. If you choose to reschedule a payment, you could pay off your loan over two months. The long-term financing option, known as Sezzle + Ally, allows consumers to finance purchases worth up to $40,000 with a loan length of up to 60 months (your payments are monthly with this option). However, you may have to pay interest for this option. While Sezzle technically doesn't charge late fees, you will get charged 'failed payment' fees if your card is expired or you have insufficient funds on your debit card or in your bank account. This fee can be up to $10, but it depends on state regulations. Sezzle has over 40,000 partner merchants, but it's not connected with as many well-known or popular retailers as other BNPL providers. You can use the service both in-person and online, but you're limited to using it at partner merchants. You just sign up for Sezzle virtual card through the app and then add it to your Google Pay or Apple Pay and use it at checkout like you would any other virtual card. Sezzle only has a few reviews on BBB but they're mostly negative. They have a 1.21/5 average rating based on 110 customer reviews at the time of writing.

Much like the other BNPL providers, Zip doesn't report these loans to the credit bureaus. It also doesn't perform any credit checks before approving customers for a loan. One of the major perks of Zip is how easy it is to use at most retailers. Zip is connected to over 51,000 merchants globally, including Sears, Target, Apple, Zara and ASOS, and customers can also use the app or the browser extension to shop at retailers that are not integrated with Zip.

There is some flexibility with payment due dates. If a customer is one day late for payment or has a delayed paycheck, Zip may move payment due dates if you contact the company and request more time.

It also does not report to the credit bureaus, so it won't affect your credit score. When it comes to determining your eligibility for a loan, PayPal doesn't check your credit score most of the time. It will, however, occasionally perform a soft credit check. According to a representative at PayPal, the company uses \"vast consumer data to understand an applicant's creditworthiness.\" PayPal 'Pay in 4', unlike the other BNPL providers on the list, doesn't have a separate app, or browser extension or website that allows consumers to use the service at online or in-store retailers not integrated with the company. PayPal does, however, have the advantage of being an established, multinational financial technology company, so it has millions of merchants available such as Uniqlo, Estee Lauder, Target and Best Buy. Since 'Pay in 4' is one of many products offered by PayPal, it doesn't have a separate BBB customer service rating.\n",

      "Buy now, pay later vs. credit cards\n",
      "\n",
      "The main advantage to using a buy now, pay later service, as opposed to paying with a credit card, is that they often don't charge interest and are easier to be approved for, though they typically require an upfront deposit. Meanwhile, credit cards stand out for usually offering some form of rewards — either cash-back, points or miles — and being more widely accepted. Although credit card interest charges can become expensive, there are a number of 0% APR credit cards that offer no interest for a period of time. Further, credit cards allow you to pay off purchases at your own pace, as opposed to a set number of fixed payments. Some credit card issuers now also offer BNPL-like options, such as the Plan It® feature from American Express, My Chase Plan and Citi Flex Pay. If you a prefer a 0% APR credit card over a BNPL service, here are some of our top picks to consider:\n",

      "FAQs When are taxes due? Federal income tax returns are due on April 15, 2024. However, Maine and Massachusetts residents will have until April 17, 2024, due to state holidays. When are quarterly estimated tax payments? While you must submit a tax return by the filing date every year, you may also need to file your taxes quarterly and make estimated tax payments. The IRS generally requires small business owners to make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe a minimum of $1,000. Filing quarterly isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all, it allows you to make four smaller tax payments versus one large tax payment. Here's when estimated tax payments are due: First quarter (January 1 to March 31): April 15\n",
      "\n",
      "April 15 Second quarter (April 1 to May 31): June 17\n",
      "\n",
      "June 17 Third quarter (June 1 to August 31): September 16\n",
      "\n",
      "September 16 Fourth quarter (September 1 to December 31): January 15 of the following year How can you make estimated tax payments? You can make estimated tax payments through some online tax software, the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) or by mailing in a completed 1040-ES form with your payment. If you mail in your payment, it must be postmarked by the due date to avoid penalties. What happens if I miss the tax deadline? If you miss the April 18 deadline, file your taxes as soon as possible. You may incur a fee if you file late, and it only gets pricier the longer you wait. If you file late and owe taxes, you’ll incur a fee. However, you won’t incur a penalty if you don’t owe and instead have a tax refund coming. That said, there’s no way to know if you’ll owe taxes or not, so it’s important to file on time. How much does it cost to file taxes? Most small business owners will have to pay for their tax prep. Unlike with individual tax returns, there are very few free programs.\n",

      "Customer reviews, when available Cost was one of the most important factors. While one of the services offers free federal filing, many business owners may want to benefit from robust software, therefore paying to file their taxes. We evaluated the price per plan and weighed the features you receive, like the ability to maximize deductions and credits. The more bang for your buck, the higher a service ranked. Whether you’re new to filing taxes or a seasoned pro, user experience is crucial to filling out and submitting your return quickly and with little frustration. The services we chose had to be relatively user friendly. The ability to speak with a tax expert or support representative was a big plus. All five of the best tax software offered some form of support. And if a service supported consumers with a generous accuracy and maximum refund guarantee, it was ranked higher. We also considered the Better Business Bureau rating associated with the software. BBB ratings help determine whether a business is operating responsibly and if it helps to resolve customer complaints promptly. Customer reviews were also taken into consideration. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall tax filing, runner-up, free tax software, most affordable and best accuracy guarantee. The federal and state filing fees for the software programs mentioned above are subject to change without notice. Many programs don’t charge you until you file, so there’s a chance the fees can change from the time you start your return until you submit it.

This write-off begins to phase out if your modified adjusted gross income hits $70,000, however, and disappears entirely at $90,000. If you're married and filing jointly, the phaseout starts at $155,000 and disappears if you earn $185,000 or more. Max out your retirement fund You can also claim deductions for contributions to qualifying pre-tax retirement accounts like an employer-sponsored 401(k) or traditional IRA. With pre-tax contributions, you're taking less out of your paycheck now. Because your money is growing tax-deferred, however, you'll pay income tax on it when you start withdrawing. Contribute to a health savings account if you have a high-deductible healthcare plan, a health savings account (HSA) allows you to save for upcoming medical expenses. Contributions are tax-free (or tax-deductible if self-funded) and the balance can grow tax-free through investments. Withdrawals are also tax-free if used for eligible expenses — like deductibles or copays, prescriptions, medical devices and even birth control. Some companies also offer flexible spending accounts (FSA), which lower your taxable income by allowing pre-tax contributions. FSAs don't let you invest, however, and the funds generally don't roll over to the following year. Sell losing stocks If you own stocks that performed badly this year, you can use your losses to offset the taxes you would pay on other investment gains — a process called tax-loss harvesting. If you have no capital gains this year, your losses can offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income — anything beyond that can carry over and be used to lower taxes. in the future.\n",

      "FAQs How do tax brackets work? Tax brackets are the various tiers your income is taxed at. You only pay a higher rate on the portion of your income that falls into that bracket, not your entire paycheck. If you earned $40,000 in 2024, for example, the first $11,600 of your income would be taxed at 10% ($1,160) while the next $13,800 would be taxed at 12% ($1,656). Your total tax liability would be $2,816. How do I calculate my tax bracket? To calculate your tax bracket, determine your total taxable income after deductions. Then, match that income to the corresponding range in the tax bracket chart for your filing status to see the rate that applies to each portion of your income. Your taxable income will likely span multiple brackets depending on how much you've earned. Does a Roth IRA put you in a different tax bracket? A Roth IRA doesn't change your tax bracket because contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you've already paid taxes on the money. What is the highest tax bracket? The highest tax bracket is currently 37%. For tax year 2025, only single filers earning at least $626,350 (or married couples filing jointly earning at least $751,600) will pay that rate on any portion of their income. Wit the TCJA sunsetting in 2025, however, the highest bracket could be 39.6% in 2026 What is the standard deduction for 2025? For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately for tax year 2025, the standard deduction is $15,000, an increase of $400 from 2024. For married couples filing jointly, it's $30,000, up $800 from 2024. For heads of households, it's $22,500, up $600 from 2024.\n",

      "Who's this for? If you have bad credit and have struggled to be approved for cards in the past, you may want to consider a card that doesn't perform a credit check. The OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card doesn't pull your credit when you apply. Like other secured cards, a minimum $200 security deposit is required to open the card and you can deposit up to $3,000. While this card is great for no credit check, it does come with a $35 annual fee, unlike the other cards mentioned above that have no annual fee.

      "Who's this for? The Discover it® Secured Credit Card is a well-rounded secured card that offers many of the benefits that are typically found with unsecured cards. Cardholders can earn cash back, receive a generous welcome bonus, use the card overseas without incurring added fees and more — all for no annual fee. Cardholders earn a competitive 2% cash back at Gas Stations and Restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter, automatically. Plus earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. The welcome bonus is also unique: For new card members in the first year only, Discover will automatically match all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year. If you earn $25 cash back at the end of the first year, Discover will give you an additional $25. This card requires a $200 security deposit, which is fairly standard for secured credit cards. It stands out from the crowd because cardholders have a clear path to upgrading to an unsecured card (and getting their deposit back). Starting at seven months from account opening, Discover will automatically review your credit card account to see if they can transition you to an unsecured line of credit and return your deposit. This takes the guesswork out of wondering when you'll qualify for an unsecured credit card. [ Return to card summary ]\n",

This card has no annual fee and minimum security deposits starting as low as $49, $99 or $200, based on your creditworthiness. If you qualify for the low $49 or $99 deposits, you'll still receive a $200 credit limit. This is a great feature considering many secured cards require $200 deposits to receive an equivalent line of credit. By using your card responsibly and making on-time payments, you may be able to improve your credit score and be considered for a credit line increase in as little as six months. In addition to paying on time, make sure you pay in full, since this card has a very high 29.99% variable APR. [ Return to card summary ]\n",

While we don't recommend carrying a balance month-to-month (especially when you're trying to build or rebuild credit), it can be a good idea to choose a low interest secured card if you have a history of carrying balances or you're looking for a safety net. There is a higher-than-average $500 minimum security deposit to open the card. But it does come with some additional perks, including travel insurance, auto rental collision damage waiver and extended warranty protection. Membership to the Digital Federal Credit Union is required, but anyone can join in one of several ways: if you're a friend or family member of a DCU member, live in select communities, work for select employers or make a one-time contribution (as low as $10) to a participating organization.

      "\n",
      "To determine which credit cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed 234 of the most popular credit cards available in the U.S. We compared each card on a range of features, including: annual fee, minimum security deposit, credit limit, rewards program, introductory and standard APR, welcome bonuses and foreign transaction fees, as well as factors such as required credit score and customer reviews when available. We also took into account how easy it is to upgrade the card from secured to unsecured and how quickly you can get your security deposit back. Because it's unusual for secured credit cards to have robust rewards programs, we did not analyze how many rewards points you can earn in the first year. For cardholders who are looking to rebuild credit, it's more important to practice good credit card habits — spending within your means, paying your balance on time and in full — than try to optimize your points balance.

Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount.

Anything over 740 is considered very good, and above an 800 FICO® score (or 781 VantageScore) is considered excellent. Scores lower than 670, and certainly scores lower than 600, will most likely disqualify you for the most affordable personal loans. But if you're in a pinch, it's not all-out impossible to get a loan with a credit score in the high 500s or low 600s. See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.\n",

      "Tips to qualify for a bad credit loan\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualifying for a loan if you have bad credit may be tricky but you can take steps to improve your chances of approval, including: Checking your credit: While you might already know your credit requires some work, knowing your score can help you weed out personal loan lenders whose credit requirements you aren't likely to meet. Plus, checking your credit report for errors and disputing them might have a positive effect on your scores.\n",

Using a co-signer or co-borrower: If a family member or trusted friend has a good credit score, you can ask them to be a co-signer or co-borrower on your loan. Co-signers have no access to loan funds or payment information but agree to repay the loan if the borrower fails to make payments. Co-borrowers, on the other hand, can access the funds and payment information and are also responsible for the loan and any missed or late payments. Note that if you don't repay the loan as agreed, your co-borrower's or co-signer's credit will be negatively impacted along with yours.\n",

Adding collateral: You can secure your personal loan by adding collateral. For example, you might be able to pledge your car or money in your savings account as collateral. If you fail to repay the loan, the lender has the right to take your collateral. This makes a secured personal loan risky but also more accessible to borrowers with low credit scores.\n",

      "Alternatives to high-interest loans\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad credit might stop you from qualifying for credit products like 0% APR credit cards or low-interest personal loans. If you want to avoid paying high interest rates, you can look into the following alternatives: Peer-to-peer (P2P) loans: P2P loans are offered by individual investors rather than financial institutions. These lenders might be more willing to work with borrowers with lower credit scores and offer lower interest rates.\n",

Typically, this type of loan doesn't require a credit check and might offer more favorable terms than a personal loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have life insurance, you can borrow from its cash value using your policy as collateral. Typically, this type of loan doesn't require a credit check and might offer more favorable terms than a personal loan. 401(k) loan: You may be able to borrow money from your workplace retirement account. You'll have to repay it with interest, but the interest will go back into your 401(k) account along with balance payments. This type of loan also usually doesn't have a minimum credit requirement. Note, however, that a 401(k) loan should be one of the last resort options as the money you borrow from your retirement account loses the potential to keep growing over time, decreasing your future retirement savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the difference between secured vs. unsecured loans?\n",
      "\n",
      "A secured loan is a loan backed by collateral. The most common types of secured loans are mortgages and car loans, where the collateral is your home or car. But really, collateral can be any kind of financial asset you own. And if you don't pay back your loan, the bank can seize your collateral as payment. A repossession stays on your credit report for up to seven years. An unsecured loan requires no collateral, though you're still charged interest and sometimes fees. Student loans, personal loans and credit cards are all examples of unsecured loans. Since there's no collateral, financial institutions give out unsecured loans based in large part on your credit score, income and history of repaying past debts. For this reason, unsecured loans may have higher interest rates (but not always) than a secured loan.\n",

Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

Achieve is an excellent debt consolidation loan option for those with imperfect credit, thanks to its flexible terms, fast approval, quick funding and relatively reasonable interest rates. To qualify for a personal loan from Achieve, you'll need a credit score of 620, which is considered fair. You can see whether you're likely to be approved when you apply online: Achieve will perform a soft credit inquiry, meaning it won't impact your score. If you opt to proceed with your application after pre-approval, the company will do a hard credit check that might ding you a few credit points. Achieve offers same-day approvals and can then send funds within 24 to 72 hours. If your credit leaves a lot to be desired, you're more likely to qualify for an interest rate on the higher end of the APR range.

      "Can I apply for debt consolidation with bad credit?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's possible to qualify for a debt consolidation loan with bad credit (a credit score of under 670). However, it's important to pay attention to the terms. Interest rates on personal loans for poor credit may at times exceed APRs on credit cards, especially if you apply with a low credit score. When that's the case, taking out a loan to get rid of your debt might not be the best option. Instead, consider other ways to tackle your balances. For instance, you might be able to negotiate repayment terms with your current creditors. It can also be a good idea to look into credit counseling and get help creating a debt management plan. Don't miss: The best personal loans if you have bad credit but still need access to cash\n",
      "\n",
      "Why can't I get a debt consolidation loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with debt consolidation loans for bad credit, approval isn't guaranteed. Lenders typically look at multiple factors when evaluating a loan application. For example, you might be denied if you don't meet income requirements or if your debt-to-income ratio is too high. Note that any lender that denies your credit application must disclose the specific reasons it has turned you down within 60 days under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the downside to consolidating debt?\n",
      "\n",
      "Debt consolidation might be an excellent debt repayment strategy but it's not perfect for everyone. Here are some disadvantages to consider: You may end up with a higher interest rate. This is especially true if you have less-than-ideal credit. Or, even if you get a lower APR, you might still pay more in interest if you've picked a long loan term.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is especially true if you have less-than-ideal credit. Or, even if you get a lower APR, you might still pay more in interest if you've picked a long loan term. You may pay upfront costs. Debt consolidation loans typically charge loan origination fees which can run high if you're dealing with a large debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Debt consolidation loans typically charge loan origination fees which can run high if you're dealing with a large debt. You might be tempted to continue spending. Merging multiple balances into one loan may feel like a weight off your shoulders. However, if you know you have trouble living below your means or saving enough, you might fall back into your old patterns once you feel free of debt. To avoid that, be disciplined about your budget and make a point to prioritize debt repayment.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does it take to get approved for a debt consolidation loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "You can expect to receive the lender's decision within a few business days. However, many lenders might also approve you instantly. For a smooth process, make sure you provide any documentation the lender requires with your application and promptly respond to requests for more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to choose the best debt consolidation loan\n",
      "\n",
      "Shopping around is crucial when you're choosing a lender or financial product. When determining the best debt consolidation loan for you, look beyond the APRs. While the interest rate is often the deciding factor, you should also pay attention to other costs associated with the loan. For instance, some lenders charge origination fees which can get as high as 10% of the loan amount. Additionally, pay attention to extra features and user experience the lender offers. For example, do they provide a convenient way for the borrower to manage their loan virtually? Is there an option to chat with customer service online? And finally, it can be helpful to read customer reviews on websites like the Better Business Bureau to ensure the lender offers a solid level of service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatives to debt consolidation\n",
      "\n",
      "A debt consolidation loan might be hard to secure if you have credit issues, and even then, the terms might not be favorable. Some alternatives to debt consolidation you can look into include: Mortgage refinancing : If you have a mortgage, you may be able to replace it with a new larger one and use the difference to consolidate debt. This type of loan is called \"cash-out refinance\". Note that most lenders require a credit score of at least 620 to qualify.\n",

Negotiating with your lenders: When managing your debt becomes challenging, don't be afraid to reach out to your lenders and credit card issuers. While not guaranteed, they may be able to offer help. For example, they may agree to lower your interest rate, develop a payment plan or provide other arrangements to make your loan more manageable. It's always best to keep open communication with your financial institutions.\n",

It's always best to keep open communication with your financial institutions. Credit counseling: In a credit counseling program, a certified financial expert will take an in-depth look at your finances and offer steps to improve your situation. For instance, they may recommend a debt management program where the credit counseling organization would develop a payment plan with your lenders for you. The most reputable organizations are nonprofits and don't charge for their services (or require a low fixed rate). You can search for a credit counseling provider at the National Federation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) and the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA).\n",

Debt relief: Debt relief companies can also negotiate what you owe with your creditors for a fee. However, debt settlement comes with potential risks as it requires that you stop making payments while the negotiation is in process. This can cause a huge hit to your credit score. Even worse, some lenders may try to sue you. Keeping this in mind, you might want to consider debt settlement the last-resort option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line\n",
      "\n",
      "Consolidating debt may be a difficult task if your credit score isn't perfect. Luckily, it's still possible to qualify for a debt consolidation loan even with a low score. It's important to do the math before taking out a debt consolidation loan. Check the APR before applying if the lender offers this option and factor in origination fees to determine whether a debt consolidation loan will save you money. If not, you might be better off finding a different strategy to deal with your debt.\n",

Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "Who's this for? While SoFi generally accepts good or excellent credit for its personal loan products, borrowers can apply for a loan using a co-applicant. A co-applicant can be beneficial for someone who has damaged or poor credit or a credit history that's so insufficient that they likely may not be approved for the loan if they applied alone. An ideal co-applicant will have a higher credit score and higher income. These attributes tell lenders that the borrowers are more likely to be able to afford to repay the loan. The co-applicant is also financially on the hook for repaying the loan if the other co-applicant fails to make payments. SoFi doesn't charge any late fees, or early payoff fees. And, you can borrow between $5,000 to $100,000, which makes SoFi an attractive option for people who need to borrow larger amounts for bigger expenses. You can get your loan funded the same day, or the next business day, providing you don't need to apply with additional information.

Upstart usually approves applicants with a FICO score of 300 or higher, but this lender also accepts applicants with no credit history, making it a good choice for someone who needs to borrow a larger amount of money but doesn't have sufficient credit history. Just keep in mind that if you are approved for the loan with a lower (or no) credit score, you may be subject to a higher interest rate. You can apply for loan amounts as low as $1,000 and as much as $50,000. The $1,000 minimum makes the loan feel a little more accessible for those who don't need to borrow too much money. It's generally best to only apply for what you'll need since borrowing more will result in higher monthly payments. And while there are no penalties for paying off your balance early, Upstart does charge an origination fee (up to 12% of the amount you borrow) and late fees ($15 or 5% of the past due balance, whichever is greater). When it comes to repaying the balance, loan terms range from 36 to 60 months, which can be appealing to borrowers who think they may need a longer time horizon to repay the entire loan.\n",

Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees.

      "Who's this for? OneMain Financial offers loan options that are much less rigid compared to other lenders. Borrowers can take advantage of repayment terms between 24 months and 60 months. This lender generally approves applicants with at least a poor or fair credit score but, like SoFi, you may be able to get a co-applicant on board to improve your chances of approval if you have insufficient credit history. Another thing that makes this lender a little more flexible is the ability to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured. But with secured loans, a borrower essentially uses another asset as a \"promise\" that if they fail to repay their loan in full, the lender can seize that asset from them as collateral. Not only does OneMain Financial give you this option, but doing so also lets you potentially receive an even lower interest rate. Plus, borrowers can actually choose the date their monthly payments are due. The origination fee is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state).\n",

      "To determine which personal loans are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with no origination or signup fees, fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $500 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall financing needs, quick funding, lower interest rates and flexible terms. See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is possible to pre-qualify for a personal loan without hurting your credit score. Do some research before you apply. Read reviews and learn what to consider before agreeing to take on a loan. When you're ready to apply, follow these steps to ensure you don't ding your score too much. Shop around for the best rate. Avoid hard inquiries by knowing your credit score before you submit a formal application so you know what you might qualify for. Many lenders will allow you to submit a prequalification form. Or consider using a lending platform (such as Upstart or LendingTree) to view multiple offers at once. Decide on the best offer. Choose the loan with the best monthly payment and interest rate for your budget. Be sure to look at how much the loan will cost you over the full length of the term and decide if the cost is worth it. Submit a formal application. Have your social security number on hand, as well as supporting documents such as bank statements and paystubs. Wait for final approval. This could take just a few minutes, an hour or up to 10 days. To facilitate speedier approval, apply during normal business hours and submit the required documents right away. Get your funds. Once your loan is approved, you'll be asked to input your bank account information so the funds are deposited into your account. You may also be able to request a paper check from your lender, or in the case of a consolidation loan, you may be able to have funds sent right to your creditors.\n",

      "What kind of loan can I get with a 580 credit score?\n",
      "\n",
      "While FICO credit scores below 580 are considered poor, you still have access to traditional personal loans. All the lenders on this list accept applicants with bad credit scores but keep in mind you'll be subjected to higher interest rates and may only qualify for shorter loan repayment terms. If you have a low credit score, you can also qualify for payday loans, but this is generally only recommended as an absolute last resort. While payday loans approve applicants with subpar credit scores, they can also have triple-digit interest rates that can easily demolish your finances. It's better to exhaust all alternatives before even going near a payday loan.\n",

      "What is a good credit score for a personal loan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most personal loan lenders consider good to excellent credit scores, which means a FICO score of at least 670. The higher your credit score, the more likely you'll be to get approved for the best personal loan rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs Can I get a personal loan with a 500 credit score? It is possible to get a personal loan with a 500 credit score, however, you're unlikely to receive favorable terms like a low interest rate. What is the easiest loan to get with bad credit? If you have bad credit, you may have an easier time qualifying for a secured personal loan that requires a co-signer. Or, you may seek out lenders that have a lower minimum credit score requirement. Can you pay off a personal loan early? It is advantageous to pay off a personal loan early since you'll save on interest charges. Just make sure the lender doesn't charge any prepayment penalties for paying off your loan early.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine which personal loans are the best for consumers with a credit score of 580 or lower, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible, we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "Who's this for? Sometimes, a potential borrower may have a low credit score because they have extremely limited credit activity. Other times, a lack of credit history may result in them having no credit score at all. Because of this, Upstart accepts applicants with no credit history — though this lender also looks at applicants with a FICO score of 300 or higher. Just keep in mind that if you are approved for the loan with a lower (or no) credit score, you may be subject to a higher interest rate. You can apply for loan amounts as low as $1,000 and as much as $50,000. And while there are no penalties for paying off your balance early, Upstart does charge an origination fee (up to 12% of the amount you borrow) and late fees ($15 or 5% of the past due balance, whichever is greater). When it comes to repaying the balance, loan terms range from 36 to 60 months, which can be appealing to borrowers who think they may need a longer time horizon to repay the entire loan.\n",

      "Who's this for? Upgrade typically looks at borrowers who have fair or good credit. With FICO, fair or good credit scores fall within the ranges of 580 to 739, and with VantageScore, fair or good ranges between 601 to 780. Many personal loan lenders offer amounts starting around $3,000 to $5,000, but with Upgrade, you can apply for as little as $1,000 (and as much as $50,000). The $1,000 minimum makes the loan feel a little more digestible for those who don't need to borrow too much money. This is especially important because it's generally best to only apply for what you'll need since borrowing more will result in higher monthly payments. Also keep in mind that Upgrade personal loans have an origination fee of up to 9.99%, which is deducted directly from your loan proceeds. So, if you know you'll need $1,000, you should account for the origination fee and apply for a loan amount closer to $1,080 to cover all your bases. Upgrade doesn't have any prepayment penalties, but it does have a late fee: If you pay late or miss a payment, you could be hit with a $10 late fee if your payment is not received in full within 15 calendar days of the due date. Otherwise, these loans are fast and easy to secure, and the funds should arrive in your checking account within one business day of submitting the required documents and being approved.\n",

Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees.

      "Who's this for? OneMain Financial offers loan options that are much less rigid compared to other lenders. This lender generally accepts applicants with at least a poor or fair credit score, but if you're worried your credit score will hurt your chances of securing a better interest rate, you may be able to submit your application with a co-applicant. Plus, borrowers can take advantage of repayment terms with a bit more flexibility compared to that of some lenders as terms range from 24 months to 60 months. Another feature that makes this lender a little more flexible is the ability to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured debt, meaning you can borrow the money outright without having to offer up something of value. But with secured loans, a borrower essentially uses another asset as a \"promise\" that if they fail to repay their loan in full, the lender can seize that asset from them as collateral. Not only does OneMain Financial give you this option, but doing so also lets you potentially receive an even lower interest rate. Plus, borrowers can actually choose the date their monthly payments are due. The origination fee with OneMain Financial is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you either $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state).

      "Who's this for? SoFi actually only considers applicants with good or excellent credit for its personal loan products. However, because this lender is very open to borrowers who need a co-applicant, it's still worth considering if your credit score is closer to the poor/fair range. A co-applicant on a personal loan can be beneficial for someone who has damaged credit, poor credit or a credit history that's so insufficient that they likely may not be approved for the loan if they applied alone. Or, sometimes a co-applicant can be used to give qualifying borrowers with an already good credit score an extra boost for securing better interest rates. An ideal co-applicant will have a higher credit score and higher income. These attributes tell lenders that the borrowers are more likely to be able to afford to repay the loan. The co-applicant is also financially on the hook for repaying the loan if the other co-applicant fails to make payments. SoFi doesn't charge any late fees or early payoff fees. And, you can borrow between $5,000 to $100,000, which makes SoFi an attractive option for people who need to borrow larger amounts for bigger expenses. You can get your loan funded the same day, or the next business day, provided you don't need to apply with additional information. Plus, when you sign up for a SoFi Personal Loan, you can join its membership platform to take advantage of a host of other perks like career counseling, financial advising and more.\n",

Avant is one personal loan lender that can typically provide funding as soon as the next business day after you're approved — of course, you'll need to be sure you have all the correct information handy and that you've accurately filled out your application to make sure you can receive funding without a hitch. Avant will consider applicants with credit scores under 600, but, again, we remind you that the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to receive the lowest, best rates. This lender also offers personal loan amounts as low as $2,000 and as high as $35,000. While there are no penalties for early payoff, there is an origination fee of up to 4.75% and a late fee of up to $25 after the 10-day grace period.\n",

      "Common personal loan definitions you should know\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some common personal loan terms you need to know before applying for one. Co-applicants or joint applications: A co-applicant is a broad term for another person who helps you qualify by attaching their name (and financial details) to your application. A co-applicant can be a co-signer or a co-borrower. Having a co-applicant can be helpful when you have a poor or fair credit score. If your co-applicant has a good credit score, you might be offered better terms, including qualifying for a lower APR and/or a bigger loan. However, both applicants' credit scores will be affected if you don't pay back your loan, so be sure that your co-applicant is someone you feel comfortable sharing financial responsibility with.\n",

However, both applicants' credit scores will be affected if you don't pay back your loan, so be sure that your co-applicant is someone you feel comfortable sharing financial responsibility with. Co-signers: A co-signer agrees to help you qualify for the loan, but they are only responsible for making payments if you are unable to. The co-signer does not receive the loan, nor do they necessarily make decisions about how it is used. However, the co-signers credit will be negatively affected if the main borrower misses payments or defaults.\n",

The co-signer does not receive the loan, nor do they necessarily make decisions about how it is used. However, the co-signers credit will be negatively affected if the main borrower misses payments or defaults. Co-borrower: Unlike a co-signer, a co-borrower is responsible for paying back the loan and deciding how it is used. Co-borrowers are usually involved in decisions about how the loan is used. Some lenders will only consider two co-borrowers who share a home or business address, as this is a firm indicator that they are sharing the responsibility of money in mutually beneficial ways. Both co-borrowers' credit scores are on the hook if either one stops making payments or defaults.\n",

Both co-borrowers' credit scores are on the hook if either one stops making payments or defaults. Direct payments: Some lenders offer direct payments when you select debt consolidation as the reason for taking out a personal loan. With direct payments, the lender pays your creditors directly, and then deposits any leftover funds into your checking or savings account. Until you see your account balance is fully paid off, it's best to keep making payments so that you don't get hit with additional late fees and interest charges.\n",

Until you see your account balance is fully paid off, it's best to keep making payments so that you don't get hit with additional late fees and interest charges. Early payoff penalty: Before you accept a loan, look to see if the lender charges an early payoff or prepayment penalty. Because lenders expect to get paid interest for the full term of your loan, they could charge you a fee if you make extra payments to pay your debt down quicker. The fees could equal either the remaining interest you would have owed, a percentage of your payoff balance or a flat rate.\n",

The fees could equal either the remaining interest you would have owed, a percentage of your payoff balance or a flat rate. Origination fee: An origination fee is a one-time upfront charge that your lender subtracts from your loan to pay for administration and processing costs. It is usually between 1% and 5%, but sometimes it is charged as a flat-rate fee. For example, if you took out a loan for $20,000 and there was a 5% origination fee, you would only receive $19,000 when you got your funds. Your lender would get $1,000 of the loan off the top , and you'd still have to pay back the full $20,000 plus interest. It's best to avoid origination fees if possible.\n",

Unsecured versus secured loans: Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning they are not tied to collateral. However, if your credit score is less-than-stellar and you're finding it hard to qualify for the best loans, you can sometimes use a car, house or other assets to act as collateral in case you default on your payments. When you put an asset up as collateral, you are giving your lender permission to repossess it if you don't pay back your debts on time and in full.\n",

      "Our methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine which personal loans are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

      "\n",
      "We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $500 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for having no credit history, borrowing smaller loan amounts, flexible terms, applying with a co-applicant and getting secured loan options. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. Before providing a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.\n",

      "How to improve your credit score\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting ready to apply for a mortgage? Raising your credit score is the first step. Pay bills on time Paying credit card bills and other debts on time is the most important thing you can do to raise your score. Your payment history is 35% of your FICO® score, making it the biggest determiner in your credit score. Paying the total amount due and not carrying a balance will keep your credit utilization rate low. (Experts recommend keeping your total utilization below 30%, but below 10% is even better.) Setting up autopay reduces the likelihood that you'll miss a payment. Don't open new lines of credit Getting a new credit card or taking out a personal loan can hurt your credit in a few ways: Applying will require a hard inquiry which can temporarily lower your score — and if you're approved, the average age of your accounts will drop. Request a credit limit increase One way to boost your credit score is to ask your credit card servicer to increase your credit limit. Provided you don't charge anything, that will increase your available credit and lower your credit utilization rate. Check for errors in your credit reports Some 44% of consumers have found errors in their credit reports, according to an April 2024 study from Consumer Reports. it's always smart to monitor your credit reports for inaccuracies, whether they're honest mistakes or signs of fraud. You can use Aura, IdentityForce or another credit monitoring service to survey your reports from Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What credit score do I need to get a mortgage? For a conventional mortgage, lenders typically want a credit score of 620. However, you'll need a score of 760 for the best rates. What kinds of mortgages are easier to get approved for? Government-backed mortgages — like FHA, USDA, and VA loans — typically have more flexible credit score requirements than conventional loans. However, they may have other limitations: VA loans are limited to current or former service members, for example, and USDA loans are only for individuals who meet income and location requirements. What is the lowest credit score to get approved for a mortgage? You can qualify for an FHA loan with a score as low as 500 if you make a down payment of at least 10%. Requirements vary by lender, however. What is a non-qualifying mortgage? A non-qualified mortgage (or non-QM loan) doesn't conform to income and credit requirements the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sets. Non-QM loans can help people with poor credit, unusual income streams or a bankruptcy in their past get a mortgage, although the interest rates are significantly higher.\n",

When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: TD Ameritrade, Inc. has been acquired by Charles Schwab, and all accounts have been moved. There are so many ways to invest your money to build your wealth. From stocks to bonds to index funds, there's a wide range of investment vehicles for every kind of investor depending on their goals. A common choice for beginner investors who want exposure to the overall stock market is to put money into an exchange-traded fund or ETF.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are ETFs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of ETFs as buckets that hold a collection of securities, like stocks and bonds. Because ETFs are made up of these multiple assets, they provide investors with instant diversification. When an investor purchases a share of an ETF, their money is spread across different investments. This differs from stocks where you buy shares of just a single company. ETFs typically mimic a market index like the S&P 500. Since ETF performance is usually based on an index — meaning they follow the ups and downs of said index — most are passively managed investments and thus likely have lower fees than mutual funds. Mutual funds, on the other hand, want to beat the market's performance and are thus managed by a fund manager, who's actively choosing the investments. Similar to stocks, ETFs can be bought and sold on an exchange throughout the day, and investors can even earn dividends depending on the type of index the fund tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should you invest in ETFs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Since ETFs offer built-in diversification and don't require large amounts of capital in order to invest in a range of stocks, they are a good way to get started. You can trade them like stocks while also enjoying a diversified portfolio. How to get started investing in ETFs First, you'll need to set up an online account through a broker or trading platform. After funding the account, you can purchase ETFs using their ticker symbol and indicating how many shares you want. Deciding on how many shares to buy largely depends on the current pricing of a share and your own financial situation. ETFs are good for beginners because they offer entry-level access: You can buy as little as a single share, and with some brokers, like Robinhood, you can even buy fractional shares. Fees vary by broker, but it's best to look for options with very low or no transaction costs. These days, many of the traditional brokerages offer commission-free trading on ETFs.

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks the entire index, and it has low management fees. Its current expense ratio is 0.03%, which means you pay just 30 cents per year for every $1,000 invested. For every $10,000 invested, that would equate to $3 per year.\n",

      "You don't have to be so hands-on in order to invest with ETFs, and investing in them is an easy way to get started in the market. If you don't feel confident choosing ETFs, consider opening an account with a robo-advisor that automatically invests on your behalf. Many robo-advisors, like Betterment, recommend low-cost ETF portfolios so you can take advantage of this investing vehicle without having to do your research on all the different options available.\n",

It comes as auto stocks have been in the spotlight in the region following stronger SUV sales in countries like India and high electric vehicle adoption in China . Mahindra and Mahindra Goldman is betting on Mahindra and Mahindra given its \"unique pipeline\" in India's SUV car market. \"M & M's evolution from a rural SUV brand in the previous decade to a lifestyle SUV brand in the current decade offers comfort on its upward trajectory in ASP (average selling price) and profit per unit dynamics,\" the investment bank wrote in a Nov. 3 note.

Its shares are up nearly 70% year-to-date. Goldman has a 12-month target price of 3,600 Indian rupees ($42.80) on the stock, implying 25% potential upside. Honda In Japan, Goldman is bullish on Honda which it describes as \"one of the few automakers that can maintain/expand its strong profit margins while making upfront investments in electrification and intelligent mobility.\" In analyst Kota Yuzawa's view, the stock stands to gain from \"growth in its motorcycle business, expanding earnings from next-generation hybrids, and appropriately controlling the timing of its investments.\" \"While some investors are concerned about a temporary decline in earnings as the company transitions to a higher EV sales weighting, we think hybrid earnings are likely to minimize this impact. At the same time, strong growth and profitability in its motorcycle division will help underpin earnings,\" he added.

      "India is hungry for energy, and it's doing something about it. As the country's population grows — already the world's largest — and becomes wealthier, its energy demand is expected to rise. It's no wonder then that the South Asian nation aims to quadruple its natural gas use from the current level by 2030 to meet that demand and enable GDP growth rates of seven or eight percent annually. However, many readers might ponder why India is buying into an energy source that nearly brought Europe to its knees only a few years ago. The Russian invasion of Ukraine came alongside skyrocketing gas prices across Europe as Moscow turned off the taps and nearly held the continent's economy hostage. The nature of the gas market, then, meant buyers begged, bribed, or bullied sellers into supplying gas to keep their lights on. So why does India want to deepen its ties with such a volatile energy source? It might not have a choice and maintaining the status quo means rising energy security risks as its economy grows. Currently, more than 80% of India's energy needs are met by coal, oil and solid biomass, according to the International Energy Agency. Both coal and oil imports have risen rapidly as the population takes a liking to round-the-clock electricity and car ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oil accounted for more than 70% of imports in Russia, Iraq and Saudi Arabia — three countries that don't have strong democratic credentials. On the demand side, the Indian government has aggressively pushed policies that favor vehicles powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), a derivative of liquified natural gas (LNG).\n",
      "\n",
      "A man opens the hood of a Blue Energy 5528 liquefied natural gas (LNG) truck to check the engine at the manufacturing facility in Pune, India, October 11, 2024. Francis Mascarenhas | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "These vehicles have taken off faster than electric vehicles as a good distribution network for the fuel has lowered range anxiety. They're also typically cheaper to run on a per-mile basis. That's allowed sales to rise 33% this year to more than half a million vehicles, with Maruti Suzuki taking the lion's share of the market. Earlier this year, the government also unveiled plans to have a third of heavy-duty trucks in the country run on LNG instead of diesel, which currently makes up the bulk of refined fuel, over the next five to seven years. Aside from transport, LNG use has grown thanks to government policy encouraging natural gas for domestic cooking. Piped connections have grown 250% to 11.9 million over the seven years ending November 2023, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Meanwhile, the number of households that could receive piped natural gas is more than 300 million. India also appears to be happy to import LNG, even from unsavory partners, if it helps balance risks in other parts of its economy. For instance, natural gas is a crucial ingredient for making fertilizers, and manufacturing it domestically helps increase food security. Rystad Energy, a consultancy, has forecasted that the demand for natural gas will likely double by 2040. The research firm also expects India to be unable to meet its demand entirely through domestic sources and will have to rely \"heavily\" on imports to meet its needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As imports rise, this will likely benefit companies that are government-owned entities such as Petronet, which owns two LNG import terminals in the country, and gas distributor GAIL. Investment banks like Citi and JPMorgan and local brokers say a steady rise in volume growth without making gas more expensive for consumers will benefit both stocks. Indraprastha Gas (IGL), Mahanagar Gas (MGL) and Gujarat Gas are other distribution companies set to reap from the growing trend. \"We prefer PLNG to GAIL on a) lower valuations and b) the volatility in GAIL's gas trading segment,\" said JPMorgan analysts in a note to clients in June. Meanwhile, Citi analysts in August said, \"We continue with our preference for GAIL, MGL, and IGL among the gas stocks.\"\n",

      "Canada alleges Indian involvement in Sikh separatists plot. The Canadian government alleged this week that Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah is behind plots targeting Sikh separatists in Canada. The allegation was revealed by Canadian Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison, who told a parliamentary panel he had confirmed to a U.S.-based newspaper that it was Shah who is the accused behind the plots. India has previously dismissed the claims as baseless. India is confident it can hit its 7% growth target for its 2025 financial year. The country's Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs Ajay Seth said on Tuesday the goal is \"very much doable.\" Seth is also optimistic about India's growth rate for its third and fourth quarters despite slower capital expenditure in some states. India's fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31 the following year. The Reserve Bank of India lowered its forecast for India's second-quarter growth. Previous estimates by the RBI put GDP growth during India's fiscal second-quarter — which is from July to September — at 7.2%. However, the RBI reduced its forecast to 6.8%, attributing it to weakness in areas like Nifty earnings forecasts and goods and service tax collections.\n",

      "\n",
      "Text: Interest in India has been picking up steadily among investors, thanks to its growing economy , strong stock market performance and burgeoning population . As the Diwali festive season gets underway in the South Asian powerhouse, several sectors — and stocks — are expected to do well, according to analysts at equity research firm Kotak Securities and asset management house Mirae Asset. Samvat 2081 — which starts on the day of Diwali on Oct. 31 — marks the start of the Hindu new year. Some investors view it as a new beginning for markets. The new year is commencing with most sectors — and stocks — being overvalued, according to Kotak's analysts. The rich market valuations, they added, make any market correction an opportunity to scoop up quality stocks with attractive valuations for the long term. Their comments come as Indian markets made history in Samvat 2080 — or last year — with the BSE Sensex surpassing 85,900 points in September while the benchmark Nifty 50 index crossed 26,250. Year-to-date, The BSE Sensex index — which represents 30 of the country's largest and most traded firms on the Bombay Stock Exchange — is up around 10.9% as of Oct. 30, while the benchmark Nifty 50 index is around 12.2% higher. Here are four buy-rated Indian stocks with over 30% potential upside that analysts are betting on this Diwali. Fiem Industries Fiem Industries is among Kotak Securities' top picks thanks to its debt-free balance sheet and robust cash flows. The manufacturer of automotive lighting and rear-view mirrors caters primarily to two-wheelers and has been \"outperforming,\" the industry, the analysts wrote in its initiation report on Sept. 3. They added that \"Fiem is well-placed to benefit from [a] two-wheeler industry recovery,\" which has picked up in the festive period, following sluggish sales between July and September. The company's growth is also supported by rising adoption of LED lighting in automotives, Kotak noted. Going forward, the analysts have penciled a 15% CAGR (compound average growth rate) for Fiem's revenue between full-year 2024 and full-year 2027, and 19% CAGR for its earnings. Shares of Fiem trade on India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and are up nearly 45% year-to-date. Kotak has a 12-month target price of 2,140 Indian rupees ($25.45) on the stock, implying around 40.8% potential upside. Gravita India Material recycling company Gravita India was another stock on Kotak's list. The research house likes that Gravita's pan-India presence across 22 states \"provides sourcing benefits and fungibility.\" Other factors in its favor include regulatory tailwinds promoting recycling and the formalization of reverse charge mechanism on metal scrap, Kotak's analysts wrote in a Sept. 30 note. Looking ahead, they expect Gravita's earnings per share to grow 31.8% in full-year 2025 and 35.8% in 2026. The stock, which is up around 85.1% year-to-date, trades on India's NSE and BSE. It is also included in the iShares MSCI India Small Cap ETF (0.1% weighting). Kotak has a 12-month target price of 2,800 Indian rupees on the stock, implying a 38.2% potential upside. S H Kelkar and Company Also on Kotak's list is fragrance and flavors supplier S H Kelkar and Company . The research house describes the company as an \"emerging player\" that is \"well-placed to drive double-digit revenue growth.\" \"SHK['s] tiny relative to global majors, but its technical capabilities are reputable,\" Kotak's analysts wrote in their Sept. 30 re-initiation report. They pointed out SHK's \"reputable\" technical skills and the inroads in global markets as other merits. \"We see a long runway for growth, given its established and sticky relationships,\" the analysts added. Shares of SHK are listed on India's NSE and BSE and are up 103.3% this year. Kotak has a 12-month target price of 400 Indian rupees on the stock, or close to 35% potential upside. Gabriel India Meanwhile, asset manager Mirae Asset is betting on Gabriel India , an automotive parts manufacturer. The company — which is owned by automotive manufacturer Anand Group — is a market leader in the manufacture of ride control products such as suspension systems and shock absorbers. Mirae likes Gabriel's steady revenue visibility and \"increasing content per vehicle\" in the shock absorber segment driven by its launch of new products. Another plus is that it is a \"key beneficiary of increasing sunroof penetration in India led by premiumization trend and import substitute,\" the analysts added in a recent note on its Diwali picks. Shares of Gabriel India are listed on India's NSE and BSE and are up 13.4% this year. According to FactSet data, all eight analysts covering the stock have a \"buy\" rating at an average target price of 581.25 Indian rupees. This gives it 30.1% potential upside.\n",

      "President-elect Donald J. Trump won the White House based partly on his promises to rein in immigration, with targeted policies that range from sending criminals to their home countries to more sweeping ones like mass deportations. During the campaign, Trump pledged to end the Temporary Protected Status that allows workers from select countries to come to the U.S. to work. If some of the larger deportation efforts, like rolling back TPS, come to fruition, experts say that there will be ripple effects felt in most sectors of the economy, in particular construction, housing and agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday night, Trump announced in a social media post that Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will be his administration's \"border czar.\" Homan had said at a conservative conference earlier this year \"No one's off the table.

      "\"The morning after the election, we sat down as a leadership team and explored what does this mean for talent availability?\" said Jason Leverant, president and COO of the AtWork Group, a franchise-based national staffing agency. AtWork provides commercial staffing in immigrant-heavy verticals like warehouses, industrial, and agriculture in 39 states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workers – \"talent\" in industry parlance – are already in short supply. While the worst of the labor crisis spurred by the post-Covid economic boom has passed, and labor supply and demand has come back into balance in recent months, the number of workers available to fill jobs across the U.S. economy remains a closely watched data point. Mass deportation would exacerbate this economic issue, say employers and economists.\n",
      "\n",

The left-leaning Center for American Progress puts the number at around 11.3 million, with 7 million of them working. The American Immigration Council, an advocacy group in favor of expanding immigration, citing data from an American Community Survey, also puts the number of undocumented people in the United States around 11 million. The non-partisan Pew Research Center puts the number at closer to 8 million people.\n",

      "\"There are millions, many millions who are undocumented who are in the trades; we don't have the Americans to do the work,\" said Chad Prinkey, the CEO of Well Built Construction Consulting, which works with construction companies. \"We need these workers; what we all want is for them to be documented; we want to know who they are, where they are, and make sure they are paying taxes; we don't want them gone.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Leverant says he is not concerned about losing any of the 20,000 workers AtWork sends to various places because document status is strenuously checked, but if other companies lose workers, they will be leaning even more heavily on staffing agencies like AtWork for talent that is already in short supply. And supply and demand dictate worker wages, which will be forced upwards. And that will ripple throughout the supply chain right into the supermarket or sporting goods store.\n",

      "According to the American Immigration Council, during the first Trump administration, the government's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied a larger percentage of H-1B petitions than in the preceding four years, but many of the denials were overturned, leading to a lower level of denials by fiscal 2020, 13%, versus 24% in 2018.

They want to come into our country. ... We want companies and factories and plants and automobile factories to come into our country, and they will be coming. And therefore we need people, but we want people that aren't necessarily sitting in a jail because they murdered seven people.\"\n",

      "The American Immigration Council estimates that in a longer-term mass deportation operation targeting one million people per year — which it said reflects \"more conservative proposals\" made by mass-deportation proponents — the cost would average out to $88 billion annually, for a total cost of $967.9 billion over the course of more than a decade.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The removal of so many workers within a short period would push up construction costs and lead to delays in building new homes, making housing even less affordable in many parts of the country,\" Wu said.\n",

Such enforcement will need to deal prospectively with the future flow of immigrants as well as grapple with the millions of illegal workers already here,\" it stated in a policy brief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among its policy priorities are mandatory use of the E-Verify system by all employers, along with severe criminal penalties for repeated or willful violations; short-term work permits available to illegal immigrants who have already been in the country for a significant period of time — but with establishment of a timeline for when they must leave the country based on how long they've already been residing in it; and for those who have resided in U.S. for the longest, the ability to obtain permanent legal status after paying a substantial fine.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"If you are building a nuclear facility or colleges and universities, you might be working with very few undocumented workers because there is a much higher level of oversight,\" Prinkey said. \"Those are sectors that will shrug and go forward.\" He expected the same for union workers.\n",

      "But there will be big impacts on single-family and multi-family housing construction, according to Prinkey, sectors of the housing market which he thinks could be \"paralyzed.\"\n",

      "\"There will be incredible delays; the average 18-month project could take five years to complete because there are so few bodies,\" Prinkey said. \"It will be less devastating in Boston than Austin; in Austin, it would shut down every project,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the dire forecast, Prinkey doesn't think mass deportation will come to pass. \"Donald Trump is a developer; he understands what is going on. A mass deportation is not possible without crippling economic impact,\" he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Frank Lipman has over 35 years of experience in functional medicine and throughout his career, he has always considered researching longevity as an extension of his work. Lipman is an author of seven books, including \"The New Rules of Aging Well,\" which he co-authored with Danielle Claro. When it comes to longevity, \"almost everything I recommend to my patients, I do myself,\" Lipman tells CNBC Make It. These are his daily practices for a long, healthy life.

      "CNBC Make It: What are some of the things you do to keep your body healthy? I exercise, that includes strength training a few times a week, aerobic and intermittent high-intensity intervals a few times a week. I walk. I move as much as I can. I tend to go to sleep at the same time every night. I do some sort of meditation practice. [I] try to do it daily. What else do I do? And I take a sh-tload of supplements [including vitamin D and fish oil]. I do hormone replacement. I do many things to optimize my health, [I'm] very proactive about my health. Almost everything I recommend to my patients, I do myself. There is a lot conversation that focuses on brain health. Are there any things you do specifically to keep your brain healthy? I've had my brain mapped. And at least five or six times a week, I [use] a red light helmet at home. I put that on for at least 15 minutes to treat whatever we found on brain mapping. You can actually measure under active and over active areas in the brain and then target those areas with specific red light frequencies. So that's what I do. Apart from exercising, and trying to deal with my stress and sleep, I use a red light helmet. Having really important connections in your life is something that we hear when we talk about longevity. What's your social fitness like? My social fitness is very good. I'm quite obsessed with spending as much time as I can with my grandson. When he gets older, he's probably not going to want to spend as much time, so I'm taking advantage. He's soon to be five, but he's still at an age where he wants to be around his grandparents. We spend a lot of family time, and then we spend time with friends as well. What are some of the foods you really aim to get into your diet, either every day or every week? I tend to eat a low sugar, low carbohydrate, high protein diet. I'm a little bit obsessed with getting enough protein in my diet, so that's my focus. That can be eggs, red meat, chicken, fish. Then I eat a lot of green leafy vegetables, non-starchy vegetables. I love fruit, but I try not to eat too much of it. But I'll eat berries. So, I would say my diet is full of protein, fatty fish, non-starchy vegetables and berries. It's a Mediterranean diet without any bread or pasta. I usually do time-restricted eating, so I usually don't eat for a 16-hour period. I eat all of my food in an eight-hour period. What are you reading right now? Lately, [I've been] digging deeper into rapamycin. That's what I've been reading. Just exploring rapamycin.\n",

      "Text: MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA - 2024/10/21: Hyundai logo is seen on the Hyundai car showroom in Mumbai. Hyundai Initial Public Offer (IPO) will be listed on the stock exchange on 22nd October 2024. (Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n",
      "\n",
      "This report is from this week's CNBC's \"Inside India\" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyundai became India's second-largest automaker by demonstrating that it understands the market by tailoring its globally popular and technologically advanced cars not only to Indian consumers' tastes but also to its roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Korean car giant, the world's third-largest passenger vehicle maker by volume, set up shop in India in 1996, soon after the country's reforms to liberalize its socialist economy. Fast forward 28 years, and the company appears to have bagged its biggest payday yet by raising $3.3 billion from the stock market by offloading a 17.5% stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock has pared back losses since, but is still 5% below its initial public offering price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares of carmaker Hyundai 's Indian subsidiary started trading this week with much anticipation, only to drop by some 7% on its debut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite such success, it appears as if the stock market has given Hyundai the cold shoulder this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares have fallen across the board with the Nifty 50 index declining by about 5% over the past month. However, investors have pointed to several elements of the listing that might have also contributed to the immediate downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the money raised by the stock market listing is being fed back to Hyundai's Korean parent. In a typical IPO, however, money raised is used to invest in growth or pay down debt. Investors have balked at the idea that the Indian subsidiary won't necessarily benefit from the cash raised on the stock market, nor has the Korean parent made it clear how it intends to use the proceeds of the share sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it appears as if Hyundai doesn't have an immediate need for the raised capital, and it's merely being opportunistic by taking advantage of what some have called \"frothy\" markets in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not that the company needed money, so it's really the parent trying to take advantage of the valuation,\" said Gaurav Narain, principal advisor at the India Capital Growth Fund , which is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The ICG fund primarily invests in Indian small and mid-cap stocks and did not participate in the IPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kunjal Gala, head of global emerging markets and lead portfolio manager of the $3.3 billion Federated Hermes Global Emerging Markets Equity Fund, speculated the decision to list the Indian subsidiary could have been born out of a need for \"a better valuation for their parent company in Korea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gala's fund holds stakes in other automakers such as Maruti Suzuki , India's largest automaker, and China's BYD . \"So, this is one way of financially engineering a better valuation, right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the listing, the Indian subsidiary now commands nearly half the market capitalization of its Korean parent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyundai has also appeared to make up for any loss of future income from its share sale by hiking the royalty fees it charges its Indian subsidiary. Royalty fees were, until June, negotiated between the Indian entity and the Korean parent on a per-model basis. However, the Indian subsidiary must now pay a flat 3.5% of total revenue going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equity analysts at financial services company Emkay initiated stock coverage with a \"sell\" rating, citing reduced earnings potential thanks to the higher royalty payment, saying, \"higher royalty, and lower treasury income are likely to restrict [earnings per share] growth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If that wasn't sufficient, a number of investors and analysts suggest Hyundai priced the stock with minimal upside for a blockbuster IPO listing, a big turn-off for most retail investors. \"What the retail investor wants is a big discount,\" Narain added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others have, however, argued that investors sitting on the sidelines of one of India's premier automakers are losing out on long-term gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We believe [Hyundai Motor India] is a good proxy to play the rising premiumisation trend in the Indian car industry,\" said Nomura's analyst Kapil Singh in a note to clients on Oct. 22.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More importantly, customers are increasingly becoming aspirational and willing to pay more for attractive designs and high-tech features.\" Singh expects the stock to rise by about 32% from Thursday's close to 2,472 Indian rupees ($29.40).\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts at Macquarie also agree that Hyundai is best placed to capture the changing face of India's middle class and rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investment bank also suggested that Hyundai India, thanks to its parent's expertise and success in developing state-of-the-art hybrid and electric vehicles for Korean and Western markets, will be best placed to offer Indian consumers a superior product compared to its competitors when the time is right for the EV transition in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We believe its strong parent [company] prepares it well to address India's evolving powertrain mix better than domestic peers,\" said Macquarie's analysts Ashish Jain and Pratik, who initiated coverage of the stock with an \"Outperform\" rating and a price target of 2,235 rupees, pointing to about 20% upside.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Top 10 things to watch Thursday, Oct. 24 CNBC's Matthew J. Belvedere with the help of Jeff Marks wrote this dispatch. 1. The S & P 500 was trying to break a three-session losing streak. Stocks were given some relief from lower bond yields, which have been recently rising despite the Fed's monetary easing. Bond traders have been pushing yields up, signaling central bankers were too heavy-handed with September's jumbo half-point interest rate cut. 2. Tesla shares were jumping 14.5% and leading the Nasdaq toward a higher open after the EV maker beat on quarterly earnings per share (EPS). While missing on revenue, Elon Musk's prediction of 20% to 30% \"vehicle growth\" next year sparked investor buying. He cited \"lower cost vehicles\" and the \"advent of autonomy.\" 3. Club industrial stocks Honeywell and Dover were dropping after issuing quarterly results. Honeywell raised the low-end of full-year earnings guidance but lowered its sale outlook. Dover's guidance was messy due to updates to reflect discontinued operations and divestitures. 4. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that longtime Taiwanese manufacturing partner TSMC helped fix a design flaw that \"caused the yield to be low\" in its next-gen Blackwell AI chips. The hiccup had hindered production. Holding an AI summit in India, Nvidia said it will supply AI chips to Indian companies. 5. Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research beat on quarterly earnings and revenue and its stock jumped 5%. The results were in contrast to peer ASML's weakness that brought down the whole sector last week before TSMC's strong results provided a boost. 6. Oppenheimer raised its Salesforce price target to $330 per share from $300 and kept its outperform buy rating. The analysts cited their survey about the technology priorities of 33 Salesforce customers. The results were mixed, they said, but pointed to industry and macro forces that should help Club name Salesforce down the line. 7. Boeing machinists rejected a new labor contract that included wage increases of 35% over four years. The walkout has been going on for more than five weeks and has halted more of Boeing aircraft production. 8. Southwest Airlines and Elliott Investment Management announced a settlement deal to avoid a boardroom battle. In exchange, the activist investor group got more director seats and accelerated the retirement of executive chairman Gary Kelly. The agreement, however, does keep CEO Bob Jordan on the job. Southwest also reported quarterly beats on EPS and revenue. 9. Shares of United Parcel Service soared 8.5% after the company reported third-quarter beats on earnings and revenue. U.S. package delivery revenue topped estimates. International as well as supply chain and freight segments matched expectations. 10. T-Mobile reported third-quarter core adjusted EBITDA of $8.24 billion, which beat estimates. So did EPS and revenue. Total wireless net additions exceeded expectations as well. The company raised postpaid net customer additions guidance for the full year. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

      "Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed on Wednesday to boost communication and cooperation between their countries and resolve conflicts to help improve ties that were damaged by a deadly military clash in 2020. The two leaders met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia for their first formal talks in five years, signaling that ties between the Asian giants have begun to recover from the diplomatic rift caused by the clash along their disputed Himalayan frontier. India and China, two of the world's biggest economies, have maintained strong trade ties despite the military and diplomatic tensions. The rapprochement is expected to boost Chinese investment in India. India said the two leaders have directed their officials to take further steps to stabilize all aspects of bilateral ties. The Xi-Modi meeting in the city of Kazan came two days after New Delhi said it had reached a deal with Beijing to resolve the four-year military stand-off in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, although neither side has shared details of the pact.\n",

Modi put forward ideas for improving and developing bilateral relations, to which Xi agreed in principle, CCTV added without elaborating. In response, Modi told Xi that peace, stability, mutual trust and respect were crucial for relations. \"We welcome the agreement on the issues that had come up over the last four years,\" Modi told Xi in comments aired on India's state broadcaster Doordarshan. \"It should be our priority to maintain peace and tranquility on the border. Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity should be the basis of our relationship,\" Modi said. Relations between the world's two most populous nations — both nuclear powers — have been strained since a clash between their troops on the largely un-demarcated frontier in the western Himalayas left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead in 2020. The neighbors have added tens of thousands of troops and weapons along the icy frontier over the last four years. Modi and Xi had not held formal bilateral talks since then, although both participated in multilateral events. Their last bilateral summit talks were held in October 2019 in the southern Indian town of Mamallapuram. The two spoke briefly on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali in November 2022. They spoke again on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Johannesburg in August 2023 but released different versions of the conversation, suggesting they didn't see eye to eye. Xi skipped the G20 summit hosted by New Delhi the following month, a decision seen as another setback to relations. Diplomatic efforts gained momentum in recent months after the two countries' foreign ministers met in July and agreed to step up talks to ease the border tensions.\n",

      "Russia is rolling out the red carpet to its geopolitical allies as it hosts the latest BRICS summit on Tuesday, pushing its agenda to create a \"new world order\" that challenges the West. The group was initially comprised of Brazil, Russia, India and China before South Africa joined in 2010, giving the organization of rapidly economically-developing nations its current name. It has since morphed into a geopolitical forum for the world's most powerful nations outside of the West. The BRICS now have additional clout after Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates joined the group in January, with membership to the bloc becoming an attractive prospect for countries looking to boost trade, investment and economic development. Russia has been trying to woo what's collectively known as the \"Global South\" — or economically-developing countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America — and contrast to the \"Global North\" of industrialized nations, traditionally led by the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently comments on his ambition to establish what he calls a \"new world order\" to rival and usurp the geopolitical and economic pre-eminence enjoyed by the U.S.-led West. Russia, holder of the rotating BRICS presidency and economically isolated and heavily sanctioned by the West, can also turn to this year's summit to demonstrate that it still commands respect on the global stage and has powerful allies willing to turn a blind eye to its ongoing war in Ukraine.\n",

      "Putin has described the beefed-up BRICS group as a \"strong indication of the growing authority of the association and its role in international affairs\" and signaled on Friday that he intends for the so-called \"BRICS +\" format to challenge the West on both a geopolitical and economic front. \"The countries in our association are essentially the drivers of global economic growth. In the foreseeable future, BRICS will generate the main increase in global GDP,\" Putin told officials and businessmen last Friday at the BRICS business forum in Moscow, which precedes the group's summit, in comments translated by Reuters. \"The economic growth of BRICS members will increasingly depend less on external influence or interference. This is essentially economic sovereignty,\" Putin added. Earlier in October, Putin said Moscow was open to using the summit for discussions with its allies on the \"the parameters of interaction in the emerging multipolar world, and is open to discussing the issues of building a new world order with all our friends, partners and like-minded people,\" he said, according to Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Putin added that \"it is in this spirit that we are preparing the BRICS and Outreach/BRICS Plus summit,\" referring to the last day of the three-day summit when officials from almost 40 Asian, African, Middle Eastern and Latin American countries are attending as part of the group's bid to expand ties with the \"Global South.\"\n",

      "The expansion of the BRICS coalition is both significant and performative, one security analyst told CNBC. \"It is indicative of a collective movement away from the West, a demonstration of a fundamental shift within the world order that is seeking to challenge Western economic hegemony,\" Callum Fraser, a research fellow in Russian and Eurasian security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, told CNBC Monday. Fraser added that it was \"still unclear to what degree BRICS+ will be able to challenge the Western-dominated G7, or even to what degree they are able to align their visions of the international system.\" \"Currently, the main glue that holds them together is the aspiration to achieve the same quality of life as in the West that they feel unable to achieve through cooperation with the West. Ultimately, BRICS+ is only anti-West in that it operates as an alternative institution. This means that it still remains to be seen what BRICS+ will provide for its member states, but increased cooperation among its members is extremely likely,\" he said. Russia's chairing of the summit would be \"utilized to maximum effect to demonstrate Russia's strong position within this emerging order,\" Fraser added.\n",

      "India and China have reached a deal on patrolling their disputed frontier to end a four-year military stand-off, the Indian foreign minister said on Monday, paving the way for improved political and business ties between the Asian giants. The news came on the eve of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia for an Oct. 22-24 summit of the BRICS regional grouping, during which he could hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian officials said. Relations between the world's two most populous nations — both nuclear powers — have been strained since clashes between their troops on the largely un-demarcated frontier in the western Himalayas left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead in 2020. The two sides had since stopped patrolling several points along the border in the Ladakh region to avoid new confrontations, while moving tens of thousands of new troops and military equipment closer to the freezing highlands. \"We reached an agreement on patrolling, and with that we have gone back to where the situation was in 2020 and we can say... the disengagement process with China has been completed,\" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said at a NDTV media conclave.\n",

Both sides will monitor the area in Ladakh to ensure that there are no violations, the officer added. Authorities in Beijing offered no immediate response to India's remarks. Officials in New Delhi said the pact clears the path for a likely bilateral meeting between Modi and Xi on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, which will be their first since 2020. The senior military officer said that both sides would pull back their troops a little from current positions to avoid face-offs, but would be allowed to patrol these areas according to a schedule that is being worked out. Monthly review meetings and regular monitoring of the contested areas by both sides would ensure there are no violations, he added. Deependra Singh Hooda, a retired senior Indian army officer who was a commander for a part of the China frontier, said that while the two sides would need fresh confidence-building measures, \"at least the impasse has been broken\".\n",

      "\n",
      "India is mourning the death of Ratan Tata, the visionary industrialist and philanthropist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former chairman of the Tata Group is known for bringing the storied salt-to-software conglomerate to the global stage via a string of high-profile acquisitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "His strong business acumen led him to become one of India's wealthiest tycoons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The billionaire placed 421 in the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022, based on his net worth of approximately 38 billion Indian rupees ($452 million). Another list by Fortune India-Waterfield captured his net worth as 160.4 billion Indian rupees, a figure that includes his stakes in Tata Sons, Tata Steel , Tata Consultancy Services , Tata Motors and Titan Company .\n",
      "\n",
      "Ratan Tata — along with the Ambani and Adani families — have become household names given their wealth and influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are, however, becoming less representative of the South Asian powerhouse's growing super-rich population.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new rich populace\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The previous school of thought was that rich people were just the Tatas, Birlas or the Ambanis. But, that's changing today — the rich are not just leaders of traditional business conglomerates,\" Himanshu Kohli, the co-founder of Indian multi-family office and private wealth manager Client Associates, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to CNBC's Inside India, Kohli noted that India's wealthy now come from a swathe of industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lots of money has been created, whether it is in the sports arena, movies, among celebrities, investment bankers or private equity professionals,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professionals, who have \"created substantial value\" in their jobs or organizations, are now also making the cut, Kohli noted. These individuals — who are often in the C-suite bracket — can \"create $50 to $200 million in wealth over a lifetime,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another group of individuals attaining the rich status are \"owners of listed companies who have sold part of their shares into the stock market rally, owners of hitherto unlisted businesses who have sold shares in their IPOs and startup founders who have sold their businesses, or shares to multinationals or bigger companies,\" said Pramod Gubbi, co-founder of Marcellus Investment Managers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comments come as more Indians choose to set up their own company instead of working for an organization. Data from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore revealed that the number of startups in India rose 71.5% from around 20,000 in 2021, to over 34,000 in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many Indian startups capitalized on the private equity boom by selling shares in 2022, prior to the funding winter. Others are now riding on India's IPO boom to cash out of their startups in the hope of making gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before the funding winter hit, a lot of startup founders created wealth by selling off their shares. That's given them a lump sum to invest and become active investors in financial markets. Others are listing now and getting substantial gains. Both moves are giving founders lots of wealth,\" Gubbi told CNBC's Inside India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere, the investment manager also observed that individuals across ages and professions have benefitted from the stock market rallies in India over the last three to four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "India's stock market became the fourth-largest in the world at the start of the year, after overtaking Hong Kong. Since then, markets have been making steady gains with the BSE Sensex index — which represents 30 of the country's largest and most traded firms on the Bombay Stock Exchange — up around 12% year-to-date, while the benchmark Nifty 50 index is around 13.8% higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is 'rich'?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no fixed definition of \"rich\" used by wealth managers. However, a widely accepted threshold for individuals in the high-net-worth bracket is 50–250 million Indian rupees. Individuals with wealth exceeding 250 million Indian rupees fall under the ultra-high-net-worth category, Kohli said. Meanwhile, those whose wealth falls between 10 to 50 million Indian rupees are in the affluent category, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "India's ultra-wealthy population — people with a net worth of at least $30 million — rose to 13,263 in 2023, a 6.1% increase from the prior year, according to Knight Frank. This number is expected to surge 50.1% between 2023 and 2028, the fastest growth rate for UHNWIs in the world, the same report stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kohli estimates that the UHNWI population is growing at 10% per annum while that of the HNWIs is 16%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This means that every few minutes 1 HNWI with a projected wealth of $1 million is born while 3 UHNWIs with upwards of $30 million is born in India every day. That's the tailwinds happening in our society today,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's also interesting is the shift in age profile of these individuals. Historically, India's wealthy had a median age exceeding 50. Today, however, seeing millionaires aged 30 or 40 is not uncommon, said Marcellus' Gubbi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another trend, he adds, is that they do not necessarily live in the nation's metropolises. \"The bulk of the accumulation of wealth has happened in bigger cities. Having said that, I think the wealth management industry is also penetrating into tier two and tier three cities,\" Gubbi said. Examples of these cities include Pune, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the city centers, he sees the wealthy coming up in industrial areas such as in the outskirts of Chennai, which are \"getting prosperous, particularly with the growth in manufacturing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Drivers of India's wealth\n",
      "\n",
      "The growth in India's wealthy population comes in tandem with the nation's economic progress. The South Asian giant is slated to become the world's third-largest economy by 2027, assuming its current growth trajectory continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"India's economy is doing well, its stock market is doing well and it is the only other economy after the U.S. to have created wealth in the stock market consistently over the last 30 years since its liberalization,\" Gubbi said. The nation's prosperity, he added, has benefitted both businesses and individuals by enabling \"stronger wealth accumulation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor fueling the rise in India's wealthy is a shift from physical assets, such as gold and land, to financial assets like stocks, mutual funds and alternatives, the investment manager observed. The move was driven in large part by a pullback in money generated predominantly through tax evasions and unaccounted transactions in real estate, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that the move to financial assets brought on \"an exponential\" growth in wealth as it yielded higher returns, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implications of a wealthy populace\n",
      "\n",
      "The legions of the wealthy in India are consequential to the nation's growth story. Their outsized influence relative to their population size on consumption patterns and investment behavior is reflective of India's economic story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think a lot of UHNWIs and HNWIs want to use their money to invest in themselves and the future generations by spending on better quality products and services,\" said Malcolm Dorson, a senior portfolio manager at Global X ETFs. Global X's parent, Mirae Asset, is one of the largest foreign asset managers in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, he expects a myriad of sectors ranging from wealth management to autos, health care, real estate and education to benefit from this premiumization wave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're seeing a lot of the UHNWI and HNWIs investing in things like luxury vehicles from say Mercedes and Volvo to good quality jewelry from Titan and better health care at private hospitals like Apollo Hospitals . And so, that's where the opportunities for growth lie in India as more people become affluent,\" Dorson added.\n",

      "Hyundai Motor India sold shares worth $989.4 million to institutional investors including BlackRock and Fidelity on Monday, as the carmaker launched a $3.3 billion IPO that will be the country's largest share offering yet. The Government of Singapore and BlackRock together picked up stakes worth a total of $77.3 million, while Fidelity bought shares worth $76.5 million. Domestic mutual funds were allocated shares worth a total $340 million. The IPO shows continued enthusiasm for India's capital markets, with 260 companies having raised more than $9 billion so far in 2024, according to LSEG data. The year-to-date volume has already surpassed the $7.42 billion total raised last year. Hyundai will not issue new shares in the IPO, in which its South Korean parent will sell up to 17.5% of its stake in the wholly-owned unit that will be valued at up to $19 billion.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: A Russian-chartered oil tanker in the sea off Morocco in an area identified by maritime technology company Windward as a hub for smuggling oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A cap enforcement crackdown runs the risk of driving up crude prices,\" he said. \"Plus, using 'secondary' sanctions to enforce the cap could push reputable insurers out of the Russian crude game entirely, leaving the market to potentially insolvent stand-ins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kevin Book, managing director of research at Clearview Energy Partners, told CNBC that despite the G-7's June and September calls for improving the price cap, and recent guidance urging parties to Russian petroleum transactions to better scrutinize cargoes, \"a U.S. pinch on Russian petroleum seems unlikely until after the election.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent report to clients, Clearview Energy Partners characterized the G-7 price cap on Russian petroleum exports to third countries as \"increasingly loose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukraine allies, including the U.S., have banned the import of Russian crude, while a price cap imposed on Russian oil by the G7 countries, the European Union and Australia bans the use of Western maritime services such as insurance, flagging and transportation when tankers carry Russian oil priced at or above $60 a barrel to nations where a ban is not enforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Clearview Energy Partners, Russian crude prices over the last four weeks have averaged about six cents below the Brent crude price. That is far off the trading discount when the cap was first put in place. When the cap was fully phased in, in February 2023, Russian crude was selling at a 30% discount. A year ago, the discount was about 16%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent data shows the discount on Russian oil narrowing and exports increasing despite the G-7 price cap on Russian petroleum exports and U.S. sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book explained that part of the narrowing of the discount is a result of Russian oil finding additional buyers, including India and China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Record volumes of sanctioned Russian oil were carried by the \"dark fleet\" and known sanctioned tankers without known insurance over September, according to a recent report from Lloyd's List.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lloyd's List Intelligence unit analysis of data from energy cargo tracking firm Vortexa revealed that 69% of all crude shipped in September was carried on dark fleet tankers and 18% was carried on tankers owned by Russian government-controlled Sovcomflot. It is the most volume moved since tracking of the monthly dark fleet data began in mid-2022 (measured by deadweight capacity of vessels.) In May, 54% was recorded, the previous high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese and Indian oil traders, refiners, and port authorities were the drivers of this growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd's List determines if a tanker is part of the dark fleet based on factors including if the ship is 15 years or older, is anonymously owned or has a corporate structure designed to conceal ownership, is handling sanctioned oil trade, and is using deceptive shipping practices. Its analysis showed a flurry of flag-hopping, where a vessel changes its country registration, as well as ownership and management changes amongst the vessels in the dark fleet to avoid detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark fleet data does not include Russia's Sovcomflot or Iran's National Iranian Tanker Co.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its data revealed that 5% of all Russian oil in September was transported by 11 tankers, with nine of those vessels sanctioned by the UK or EU between July and September and owned by the Russian government-controlled tanker company Sovcomflot. The remaining vessels were sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control for breaching sanctions on Syrian and Iranian oil. Those vessels are the Eternal Peace and Nebulax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the Sovcomflot tankers that Lloyd's List identified in its report were sanctioned by the UK or EU between July and September. Some tankers changed vessel names, reflagged the vessel's origin to Barbados, or redomiciled registered ownership to Seychelles and changed their ship management to a newly incorporated UAE-based ship manager, Avebury Shipmanagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece-owned tankers have shipped 23% of oil from Russia in September, consistently over the last three months, according to Lloyd's List. The majority of the UK- and EU-sanctioned tankers have already discharged their oil in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said despite the price cap, some ship owners have decided that it was extremely profitable to have their vessels become part of the dark fleet and risk United States and EU sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all, Russian oil continues to be purchased by Chinese and Indian refiners with little repercussions from the U.S. or EU,\" said Lipow.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told CNBC, \"Two years since the price cap was implemented, it is unsurprising that Putin is still sinking money into building and maintaining a shadow fleet to escape the Coalition's sanctions: that evasion costs the Kremlin, and diverts money that would otherwise be going to the battlefield. The Price Cap Coalition continues to engage with industry to ensure compliance with the price cap and to increase Putin's costs of going outside it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of uninsured vessels carrying sanctioned oil also increased, according to Lloyd's List, with some 201 of the 310 tankers tracked not having insurance with the 12 clubs that form the International Group of P&I Clubs. That represented 68% of the vessels when measured by deadweight, and the lowest number of tankers tracked with IG club insurance, surpassing 67% uninsured recorded in July and August.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lipow said the oil market is pricing in a greater probability of a war between Iran and Israel that could impact supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The biggest risk to the oil market is the closure of the Straits of Hormuz, and while unlikely, if it were to happen, oil prices would rise $30 per barrel,\" he said. Despite the hostilities, oil prices remain under pressure, he said, as increased production from the U.S., Canada and Guyana adds to the supply picture while OPEC+ delays the restoration of its production cuts.\n",
      "\n",

      "Last week, we sold shares of industrial laggard Honeywell three times, bringing the position down to levels that Jim Cramer said won't hurt us. On Wednesday, when the already running Wells Fargo Morgan Stanley discipline called for us to take some profits, which we did. BlackRock, one of our newer positions, was not participating in Wednesday's rally in financials, so took some of those bank stock proceeds and bought some more shares of the world's biggest asset manager. We said last weekend that the risk to the market was not so much who won, but that whoever won did so decisively. That's exactly what we got. Wall Street, however, has traditionally liked gridlock in Washington over the long term, a situation created by a split Congress or the White House controlled by one party and Capitol Hil by the other. The exact combination remains up in the air. While the presidential race was decided quickly and the Republicans flipped the Senate, there were still House races too close to call, according to NBC News. As of Sunday afternoon, Republicans needed to win six of them to capture the majority. Only time will tell how the balance of power will play out and whether it's good or bad for the stock market. But one thing we do know is that Trump likes to grade himself on how the market performs. In Trump's first term, from Inauguration Day 2017 to his last day in office, the S&P 500 gained 67%. Barring anything catastrophic, President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris will hand Trump the baton of a healthy economy with moderating inflation and a strong stock market. In the week ahead, two government inflation reports are released that Wall Street and the Fed will be watching closely. Earnings season starts to wind down and only two Club names, Home Depot and Disney , report quarterly results.\n",

      "The big economic report for the week, the October consumer price index, comes out before Wednesday's opening bell. According to estimates compiled by FactSet, economists are looking for a 2.6% annual increase in headline CPI, slightly hotter than in September. The core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is seen rising 3.3% on a year-over-year basis, matching the prior month. The shelter component of the CPI, which accounts for roughly one-third of the entire index, will also be a key focus given how sticky the cost of housing inflation has been. While not as closely watched as the CPI, the October producer price index, which is out Thursday, could influence the markets. The monthly PPI readings are still important to monitor as they show wholesale prices that companies pay, often referred to as input costs, and whether they need to raise consumer prices to protect their margins. According to FactSet, economists expect to see a 2.3% annual increase in headline PPI and a 2.9% year-over-year increase in the core rate. Among the other data points this week, October retail sales and October industrial production are both out Friday. Retail sales give us a snapshot of the state of the consumer and where they're focusing their buying power in the lead-up to the holiday shopping season. Roughly two-thirds of the nation's economy is driven by consumer spending. The monthly industrial production and capacity utilization report provides insight into the manufacturing industry, which has been under pressure for quite a while, as well as the mining, and electric and gas utilities industries.\n",

We were encouraged to see bond yields drop on Thursday and Friday after spiking on Wednesday. We hope that continues with the Fed in easing mode and market odds favoring another rate cut in December. Additionally, a likely boost to Home Depot sales, partially in the reported quarter and likely more so going forward, will come from the recovery process after hurricanes Helene and Milton as insurance claims come through and homeowners look to rebuild. That said, we're biding our time and predict that once the housing market really starts to inflect, Home Depot will be a primary beneficiary.

After losing his reelection bid to President Joe Biden in 2020, Trump, the 45th president, will now become the 47th. Trump's victory marks a series of historic firsts. At 78, he is the oldest person ever to win a U.S. presidential election. He will be the first president in 132 years — since Grover Cleveland — to serve two nonconsecutive terms in office. And he emerged victorious from what is likely the most expensive presidential race in history. He is also the first president, current or former, ever to be convicted of crimes. He is the first twice-impeached president ever to win back the White House. He is the first president ever to take office while fending off criminal charges in multiple active federal and state cases. Trump's win denies Harris, the vice president, what would have been her own historic milestone: becoming the first woman president of the United States.\n",

      "It also represents a staggering political achievement for Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who won his first election just two years earlier. Just 40 years old, Vance, a former Trump critic turned loyalist and top advocate for the president-elect's right-wing populist movement, is now first in the presidential line of succession. If Trump pursues his campaign promises, his second administration will soon set out to enact an ambitious, controversial agenda centered on deep tax cuts, mass deportations and reshaped relationships with foreign leaders. Trump has also vowed to impose heavy tariffs, claiming that they will simultaneously boost U.S. revenues, strengthen domestic industries and deter unwanted foreign competition. Mainstream economists have repeatedly warned that the tariffs, which are taxes paid by U.S. importers, will raise prices on American consumers. It remains to be seen to what extent Trump's presidential agenda will resemble the sum of his many claims as a candidate. He has vowed to pardon his supporters who violently rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He has assured that he will quickly broker an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a vague stance that threatens to undo the Biden administration's policy of strong support for Kyiv. He has said he would put Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, in charge of health policy, and tap billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk to propose trillions of dollars in government spending cuts. He has denied Democrats' warnings that he will behave in office like a dictator, \"except for Day One.\"\n",

      "The campaign that delivered Trump's election was no less historic. Trump survived an assassination attempt in mid-July, when Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old registered Republican who had donated to a Democratic group, opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Crooks fatally shot one rally attendee, and one of his bullets grazed Trump's ear, streaking his face with blood. Trump's immediate reaction to the shooting — pumping his fist and defiantly telling his supporters to \"fight!\" as Secret Service agents rushed him off stage — instantly became a defining moment of the campaign. Just a few days later, the race was shaken up again. In late July, Harris, 60, was catapulted to the top of the Democratic presidential ticket after Biden announced he would no longer seek reelection.\n",

      "Avoiding a confirmation fight\n",
      "\n",
      "While the prospect of a Trump comeback has motivated progressives to rally around Harris in the near term, many still worry about the direction of the party, particularly as it welcomes more affluent and center-right voters who are turned off by the MAGA-infused GOP. Will Democrats continue to be a populist, worker-oriented party? Or will the electoral realignment cause them to start catering more to business? If Harris loses, Democrats will have bigger problems, of course. But if she wins, activists and party stakeholders will be looking at what she does with Khan as one clue about how she sees the future of the party. \"It'd be a strategic blunder for Harris to pick an ugly fight over Lina Khan's future when there's already strong consensus among Democrats. Moderate senators like Bob Casey and Jackie Rosen are actively campaigning on the FTC's work to lower prices,\" said a Senate Democratic aide, who was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. \"Progressives are ready to fight, but if Harris caves to her billionaire donors it will be her prosecutor brand and the entire Democratic Party that gets bruised in an unnecessary brawl.\" Cuban's call for Khan's ouster led Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to issue a warning to the \"billionaires ... trying to play footsie\" with Harris: \"Anyone goes near Lina Khan and there will be an out and out brawl. And that is a promise,\" she said on X. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also threw in for Khan, calling her \"the best FTC chair in modern history.\" The Harris campaign declined to comment for this story. Progressives have inertia on their side. Khan, whose term expired last month, can remain in the role until she is replaced. Removing her would not only infuriate the left but it could provoke a confirmation fight with Senate Republicans over her replacement. Some in the progressive movement believe Harris should simply leave her there without going through confirmation again in the Senate if need be. Khan has broad support among Democrats and even some Republicans, including moderates outside the progressive movement. \"Khan has a lot of allies in Congress,\" said Deiseroth. \"Keeping her is the path of least resistance that will make the most people on the left happy.\" Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry and its allies also want to replace Gensler atop the SEC, since he has taken a skeptical view of the nascent industry. The main pro-Crypto super PAC Fairshake has spent more than $204 million on the 2024 elections, cultivating a slew of new allies in Congress and in Harris' orbit, including Cuban. Harris herself has said relatively little about her thoughts on cryptocurrency, which makes progressives worry that in the absence of strong views of her own, and little organized opposition from crypto skeptics, they could have a hard time being heard. Jeff Hauser, the founder of the progressive watchdog Revolving Door Project, said he's hoping Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, the current chair of the Senate Banking Committee, will win his tough re-election contest to serve as a countervailing voice inside the party. \"The more an issue touches on crypto, the less confident I am in her team,\" he said.\n",

      "Donald Trump has ramped up his baseless accusations that Democrats are plotting to \"cheat\" or \"steal\" the election, raising fears that the former president is setting the stage for an attempt to overturn the result if Vice President Kamala Harris wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "But any effort to derail the electoral process would run up against an array of new guardrails this time around, legal experts say, making it unlikely that any such attempt would succeed. The new protections include: an electoral law Congress passed in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection, recent court rulings, more vigilance from state election officials and more aggressive law enforcement by agencies determined to avoid a repeat of violent scenes from the U.S. Capitol four years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very hard this time,\" said law professor Richard Hasen, an election expert at UCLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, Trump issued similar warnings before the vote. When he lost to Joe Biden, he lobbied officials in swing states to overturn the result, filed a flurry of lawsuits claiming fraud and demanded his vice president, Mike Pence, refuse to certify the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "But state officials resisted his pressure, judges tossed out his team's lawsuits, and Pence defied Trump and carried out his constitutional duty to affirm the result of the vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike in 2020, Trump is no longer the president and does not have the power of the executive branch at his disposal. And the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act, passed in 2022, tightened the process to cast and count electoral votes, gave federal courts a clear role to quickly resolve disputes and made it more difficult for lawmakers to raise frivolous objections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some attempts by pro-Trump groups to alter how votes are counted and certified have already failed, with judges rejecting the measures as illegal and unconstitutional. Last week, Georgia's Supreme Court rejected an effort by pro-Trump Republicans to introduce new election laws in the state, including one that would have required hand-counting of ballots and others that would have delayed the certification process.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Trump sought to challenge the election results, he would have two potential paths to try to overturn the results, and both routes are \"long shots,\" said Hasen, director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA Law School.\n",
      "\n",
      "One would be to try to delay certifying the results in certain counties or states by alleging irregularities or making other claims. Dozens of state and local election officials are now in office in swing states who have openly rejected the 2020 results, raising the possibility that they could refuse to certify the vote count or cause other delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "But such efforts would most likely fizzle out, legal experts said. State secretaries of state and attorney generals in key states like Pennsylvania and Arizona have vowed to take local governments to court if they try to delay the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may still have some people trying to engage in these shenanigans,\" said Gowri Ramachandran of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. \"But I think, ultimately, a combination of the state election officials, the attorney generals, who often represent them in court, and the courts themselves are going to tell people to just do their jobs and certify the correct results.\"\n",

      "Last month, top officials in three swing states — Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin — said they are ready to take local government authorities to court if they refuse to certify the results.\n",

      "Former Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries and his associate pleaded not guilty Friday to federal criminal charges that he sexually exploited dozens of men, many of whom sought to be models for the clothing brand. Jeffries, 80, and James Jacobson, 71, appeared in U.S. District Court in Long Island, New York, three days after being arrested on sex trafficking and interstate prostitution charges. The graphic 16-count indictment unsealed Tuesday accuses Jeffries and his romantic partner Matthew Smith, 61, of operating an international sex trafficking enterprise over more than six years, most of which overlapped with Jeffries' tenure as CEO of Abercrombie. Jacobson allegedly worked as a recruiter for the \"Sex Events,\" and would allegedly require prospective candidates to participate in \"tryouts\" with him.\n",

      "The defendants allegedly used \"coercive, fraudulent and deceptive\" recruiting tactics, including by leading men \"to believe that attending the Sex Events could yield modeling opportunities with Abercrombie or otherwise benefit their careers,\" the indictment says. If convicted, Jeffries and Jacobson face a maximum sentence of life in prison on the sex trafficking charge alone, and a mandatory minimum of 15 years behind bars. They could also receive as much as 20 years behind bars if convicted on all 15 counts of interstate prostitution. \"Today's hearing was procedural in nature, bond has been set to ensure Michael's appearance in court and of course we entered a plea of not guilty,\" Brian Bieber, an attorney for Jeffries, told CNBC in a phone call after the arraignment. Smith was also arrested Tuesday and faces the same charges. He and Jeffries were both arrested in Florida, while Jacobson was arrested in Wisconsin, where he lives.

      "\n",
      "Kamala Harris mocked Donald Trump's behavior at an unusual campaign event, where the GOP presidential nominee cut short a question-and-answer session to listen to music with the crowd for nearly 40 minutes. \"Hope he's okay,\" Harris, the Democratic nominee, wrote on X early Tuesday morning. The vice president's tweet was replying to her campaign X account's post saying, \"Trump appears lost, confused, and frozen on stage as multiple songs play for 30+ minutes and the crowd pours out of the venue early.\" It was one of many posts by social media users that raised eyebrows over video from Monday night showing Trump swaying to music at his event outside Philadelphia. Trump, 78, in turn, on Tuesday suggested that Harris was unqualified to be president because of her minor allergies and hives, which were disclosed in health records she released this weekend. But Trump also doubled down on his refusal to release his own health records — which Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have cited as they question his fitness for office. Trump's campaign event Monday night was billed as a town hall where Trump would take questions from South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. But the Q&A portion was disrupted twice by medical emergencies in the crowd. At one point, the song \"Ave Maria\" played on the speakers as Trump and Noem waited for medical workers to attend to a person. After the second interruption, Trump stopped taking questions. \"Let's not do any more questions,\" Trump announced. \"Let's just listen to music. Let's make it into a music. Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "He then stood onstage facing the crowd, largely without speaking as a series of songs played through the venue's speakers. The music-listening portion of the evening went on for nearly 40 minutes. The songs included, \"Time to Say Goodbye,\" by Andrea Bocelli, Sinead O'Connor's \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" Village People's \"Y.M.C.A.,\" James Brown's \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World,\" and Guns N' Roses' \"November Rain.\" Trump left the stage to the sounds of \"Memory\" from the musical \"Cats.\" Trump in a subsequent Truth Social post called the town hall \"amazing!\" \"The Q and A was almost finished when people began fainting from the excitement and heat. We started playing music while we waited, and just kept it going,\" he said. \"So different, but it ended up being a GREAT EVENING!\" In other Truth Social posts early Tuesday, Trump claimed he was \"far too busy campaigning to take time\" to devote to medical exams. But he also asserted that he has \"already provided them, many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless.\" And in another post later Tuesday, he declared, \"MY REPORT IS PERFECT - NO PROBLEMS!!!\" He told CBS News in August that he would \"very gladly\" release his medical records, but his campaign has yet to do so. When CNBC asked the Trump campaign for the records that Trump claims he has already provided, spokesman Steven Cheung referred to his statement from Saturday that said Trump has \"voluntarily released updates\" from multiple sources. He pointed to a note last November from Trump's personal physician, Bruce Aronwald, and two memos written in late July by former White House physician Ronny Jackson after Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. \"All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,\" Cheung wrote. Aronwald's 11-month-old, glowing letter concluded that Trump is \"in excellent health\" and likely to \"enjoy a health active lifestyle for years to come.\" But it offered few details about Trump's medical history. The memos by Jackson focused on the injury Trump sustained when a bullet grazed his ear at the July 13 rally. Jackson, now a Republican congressman who represents a Texas district, is one of Trump's most loyal supporters. Harris on Saturday released a letter from her White House doctor describing the 59-year-old vice president as being in \"excellent health\" and capable of carrying out the duties of the presidency.\n",

After taking an antihistamine and an allergy medication, both issues have \"improved dramatically\" to the point that Harris has not needed any medication to manage her symptoms apart from an occasional nasal spray, Simmons wrote. A day after releasing her records, Harris blasted Trump at a campaign rally in North Carolina. \"He refuses to release his medical records,\" Harris said at the rally on Sunday. She also mocked Trump for recently ducking an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" and for declining to debate her a second time. \"Why does his staff want him to hide away?\" she asked. \"Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?\" Trump tried to flip that script on Harris on Tuesday.\n",

      "The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene across the southeastern United States could cost upwards of $34 billion, according to early estimates from Moody's Analytics. And due to the eroded state of the private insurance landscape in some affected areas, Congress may have to foot the bulk of the bill. \"I wouldn't be surprised if [Helene] sends another monkey wrench into the insurance market,\" Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi told CNBC. Uprooted trees, winds of 140 miles per hour winds and mass flooding ravaged towns and cities in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee over the past week. As of Thursday, the storm had killed more than 200 people and left hundreds more missing. Nearly 1 million people remained without power.\n",

      "The Moody's report, released as Helene was making landfall last week, estimated that property damage could cost between $15 billion to $26 billion. And the resulting economic slowdown could cost $5 billion to $8 billion in productivity losses. These initial estimates are low and will likely be revised higher as the full scope of the storm's damage comes into view, Zandi told CNBC. Most of the damage from Helene is attributable to storm surges and river flooding. That means flood insurance, not standard property insurance, is supposed to cover the damage, according to Mark Friedlander, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. That is a problem, Friedlander said, because \"many of the hardest-hit areas of the Southeast and southern Appalachia have very low flood insurance take-up rates.\"\n",

      "Only about 6% of U.S. homeowners have flood insurance through either a private company or the congressionally funded National Flood Insurance Program, despite 90% of natural disasters involving flooding, he said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which in the past year has operated on a tight budget, has been coordinating the recovery response to Helene. On Aug. 7, FEMA triggered its \"Immediate Needs Funding\" status as money ran low in its Disaster Relief Fund. That meant the agency would only spend on immediate disasters and paused its longer-term rebuilding efforts across the country. On Tuesday, FEMA got a much-needed $20 billion cash infusion after Congress' stopgap funding bill went into effect. But as government officials assess the full scale of Helene's damage, they are expressing an increasing need for Congress to pass a supplemental disaster relief funding package, which was stripped out of its temporary spending resolution. That could take some time as Congress is on recess until Nov. 12. President Joe Biden said Monday he \"may have to request\" that Congress end its recess early and return to Washington, a rare move, to pass funding for additional disaster relief.\n",

      "The commodities exchange KalshiEx resumed taking bets on the outcome of the 2024 congressional election Wednesday, hours after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., lifted a legal freeze on such contracts. And Kalshi's website says the exchange on Thursday will begin accepting bets on the outcome of the presidential election between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The appeals court in a decision rejected an effort by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to prohibit Kalshi from offering \"Congressional Control Contracts\" while the federal agency appealed a lower court's ruling that had given a green light for such bets. The CFTC is continuing to appeal that lower court ruling, and later Wednesday asked the appeals court to expedite its case, and schedule oral arguments for early December, a month after Election Day. Kalshi's website as of Wednesday evening showed two types of events-based contracts related to the control of each chamber of Congress. A total of $45,000 of contracts had been purchased as of 9:44 p.m. ET on contracts related to \"Which Party will win the Senate,\" with 75% of those bets predicting Republicans will regain control of that chamber, and 25% predicting that Democrats will retain their majority. Another $20,000 had been wagered on \"Which party will win the House,\" with 63% of the bets on Democrats regaining control, and the remainder on Republicans. A separate page on the exchange's site featured the question, \"Who will win the Presidency?\" but was not accepting bets on either Trump or Harris, as of Wednesday evening. Instead, that page had a link that said, \"Notify me,\" with a countdown clock showing fewer than 19 hours remaining on it. The link connects to pages where users can create Kalshi accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CFTC in legal filings argues that the contracts might cast doubt on the integrity of elections. But in its ruling Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia Circuit said the CFTC \"has failed to at this time to demonstrate that it or the public will be irreparably injured\" without a stay on the contracts being offered during its appeal; Judge Patricia Millett, who wrote the 15-page ruling, said the agency could renew its emergency bid to block the contracts pending resolution of the appeal \"should substantiating evidence arise.\" There were no dissents on the decision in favor of KalshiEx, which offers customers contracts that can hedge the risk of certain events occurring. The contracts at issue in the case are bets on predictions of which political party will control the Senate and the House of Representatives at a future, specified date. On Wednesday, Kalshi's co-founder Tarek Mansour in a social media post touting the ruling suggested the exchange might offer contracts on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Kalshi would allow individuals or entities to invest up to $100 million per congressional contract, he wrote. The CFTC opposes the contracts because of concerns they could be used by foreign individuals or governments \"directly or indirectly to manipulate the election-contract market,\" despite Kalshi's claim that only U.S. residents would be allowed to invest, the ruling noted. But Millett wrote, \"While the question on the merits is close and difficult, the Commission cannot obtain a stay at this time because it has not demonstrated that it or the public will be irreparably harmed while its appeal is heard.\" \"That failure is fatal to the Commission's stay request because a showing of irreparable harm is a necessary prerequisite for a stay,\" the judge wrote. The CFTC declined to comment on the ruling, but noted that \"this is for our request for an emergency stay. Not the appeal itself.\" KalshiEx did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The non-profit investor advocacy group Better Markets blasted the appeals panel's decision. \"The court's order will allow betting on an incredibly close and contentious race just weeks before the election. That makes this a sad and ominous day for election integrity in the United States,\" said Stephen Hall, legal director of Better Markets. \"The Court concluded that the CFTC had failed to show that the agency or the public would be irreparably harmed if trading went ahead while the appeal is heard. Yet, the Court conceded the various threats of election and market manipulation posed by the contract,\" Hall said. \"Moreover, it acknowledged that the merits were 'close and difficult,' suggesting the CFTC has a decent chance of winning ultimately. The record clearly includes concrete examples of election interference, which substantiates the threat of irreparable harm. Under these circumstances, and with so much at stake, the Court could have and should have gone the other way.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "House lawmakers are using former President Donald Trump's own words as leverage to pressure their colleagues into preserving the original state and local tax deduction, with a fight set to take shape next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SALT deduction allows tax payers to deduct up to $10,000 of property, sales or income taxes that have already been paid to state and local governments. Historically, most of the tax payers who claim the deduction reside in high tax states such as New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and California.\n",

Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y.\n",

House Ways & Means is responsible for helping write and pass tax legislation.\n",

      "Garbarino said he estimates there are at least a dozen House Republicans who won't support a tax bill with a SALT cap at $10,000 and, at a minimum, will fight for the cap to be at a much higher level.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: DuPont shares jumped Tuesday after the Club holding reported a solid set of third-quarter results, raised earnings guidance and told investors that a key catalyst for the stock could arrive sooner than some expected. The report showed why we've stuck with DuPont this year despite frustration on its stock performance. Net sales in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 4.4% year over year to $3.19 billion, a hair short of the $3.2 billion estimate, according to LSEG. Organically, sales were up 3% versus the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 28.3% year over year to $1.18 per share, exceeding expectations of $1.03 per share, LSEG data showed. Operating EBITDA of $857 million in the quarter came in ahead of the $818 million consensus, according to FactSet. EBITDA — a measure of profitability — is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Shares rose nearly 6% Tuesday, to nearly $87 a share. DD YTD mountain DuPont's year-to-date stock performance. Bottom line DuPont delivered a very good report Tuesday that gives us the confidence to reiterate our 1 rating and price target of $100 a share. DuPont's performance on profitability metrics shined, with the better-than-expected operating EBITDA and earnings results for the quarter compounded by an increase to management's full-year outlook on both metrics. Profit margin performance was also strong, as was cash flow generation, with transaction-adjusted free cash flow conversion of 130% — a sign of healthy of earnings. DuPont defines that metric as adjusted free cash flow excluding transaction costs associated with its impending business separation divided by adjusted earnings. While sales in its water-and-protection unit came up short of expectations, the miss there was more than offset by the beat in electronics-and-industrial sales. That's important to note because it means sales at DuPont's two core units — excluding the corporate-and-other segment — on a combined basis were actually better than expected, helped by recovery in China. The world's second largest economy has recently been a headwind for DuPont and a host of other U.S. companies doing business there. The corporate-and-other line includes retained businesses from the previous divestiture of DuPont's mobility-and-materials operations, which aren't really the focus of investors. It's also much smaller than its two counterparts. DuPont Why we own it: We added this specialty chemical maker as an industrial way to play the recovery in the semiconductor and electronics industries, which have strong multiyear outlooks due to advancements in AI. The company also is getting past excess inventory issues in a few business lines. More recently, DuPont's plan to split itself into three separate companies has sweetened the investment case. Competitors : 3M , PPG Industries Portfolio weighting: 3.49% Most recent buy: Aug. 5, 2024 Initiated : Aug. 7, 2023 In addition to the better-than-expected results for the core business, DuPont offered an encouraging update on its planned separation into three separate publicly traded companies — a crucial catalyst for the stock. Executive Chairman Ed Breen said DuPont is looking to get the breakup done closer to the shorter end of the 18-to-24-month timeline offered when the plan was disclosed in May . If the transaction is in fact finalized closer to 18 months from the initial announcement, that would be around December 2025. The result will be a standalone company consisting of its water business, an electronics-focused firm tied to AI and the remaining DuPont, which serve the health care and construction markets, among others. We continue to view this as a smart way to ensure DuPont's varied businesses are appropriately valued by investors, boosting the stock price as a result. While the stock may not fully reflect all of that value until the separation is complete — or at least until we get closer to and have more certainty on the date it will finally happen — patient investors will be rewarded. Quarterly results Another reason to look past the light water-and-protection sales: Operating margins at both of the core business units were ahead of expectations. That is an indication that while DuPont's end markets are still in recovery mode, the businesses are being run more efficiently than expected. For the electronics-and-industrial segment, management said operating EBITDA was helped, in part, by increased volume gains along with savings from productivity and restructuring actions. The water-and-protection unit's profitability was aided by productivity and savings from restructuring actions, which more than offset a decline in organic revenue and higher variable compensation. Diving into the electronics-and-industrial unit by end market: Semiconductor technologies sales advanced over 20% year over year on organic basis, driven by strong AI demand, including out of China. Interconnect solutions sales increased low-double digits organically thanks to the continued recovery in the consumer electronics end market as more devices are becoming AI-capable. For what it's worth, that's a positive readthrough for fellow Club holding Best Buy . Industrial solutions sales fell slightly on organic basis as weakness in Kalrez — which makes O-rings and specialty sealant products — was only partially offset by strength in printing and packaging applications. Now digging into the water-and-protection segment: Safety solutions revenues were down mid-single digits on an organic basis due to lower prices and a decrease in medical packaging products sales volume versus the year-ago period. Still, sales of medical packaging products were up 10% quarter over quarter, the second consecutive sequential increase and further evidence of a recovery in progress. Shelter solutions saw sales fall slightly on an organic basis as weakness in the North American residential construction market was only partially offset by increased activity in the commercial construction end market. Water solutions were up low-single digits organically as China continues to recover. Guidance Management raised its full-year guidance for operating EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. However, its revenue forecast was tweaked a bit lower. The company now expects net sales to be about $12.365 billion, down from a prior range of $12.4 billion to $12.5 billion, and below the $12.43 billion expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The operating EBITDA guide was raised to about $3.125 billion, up from a prior range of $3.06 billion to $3.11 billion. That's better than the $3.094 billion Wall Street was looking for, according to FactSet. Adjusted EPS is now projected to be about $3.90, exceeding the $3.78 consensus estimate, according to LSEG. DuPont had previously offered a range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. For the fourth quarter, DuPont guided to roughly $3.07 billion in sales, $790 million in operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS of 98 cents. All were weaker than expected. Analysts had been looking for $3.13 billion in sales and EPS of 99 cents, according to LSEG, and $797 million in operating EBITDA, according to FactSet.

      "Text: Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. 1. Wall Street was rallying Tuesday as voters headed to the polls on Election Day. The Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.3%. The S & P 500 was up roughly 1%. Jim Cramer called this a \"relief rally\" in anticipation of the U.S. election being over. A bright spot in the portfolio is DuPont , which rose more than 6% on Tuesday after the conglomerate delivered an earnings beat before the open. Even with Tuesday's move, the stock hasn't performed as well as we hoped this year, but we expect that its looming breaking up into three separate companies will help DuPont get the respect it deserves from investors. Check your emails and text later for our full DuPont earnings analysis. 2. Shares of Eaton rose more than 1% higher Tuesday after Bernstein initiated coverage on the Club stock with a buy-equivalent outperform rating and a price target of $382. That PT implies 13% upside from Monday's close. The analysts said electricity demand is entering an era of secular growth driven by electrical infrastructure investments over the coming years. Jim agreed that Eaton shares are positioned to go higher given the company's business is all about electric equipment and power management systems. We trimmed our Eaton position on Oct. 29, before the company reported earnings on Oct. 31, to lock in gains after the stock's huge run. 3. Coterra Energy CEO Tom Jorden appeared on \"Mad Money\" and cleared up a comment he made on the company's third-quarter earnings call last week. During the call, Jorden talked about hypothetical situations that could lead the company to \"stretch\" on M & A, and the stock took a hit. Jorden told Jim on Monday evening that he regretted the statement, saying Coterra is not considering a big acquisition that could stretch its balance sheet. \"I felt very good about the stock after the interview,\" Jim said on Tuesday's Morning Meeting, adding he might be inclined to build a bigger position oil and natural gas producer in the event of a Donald Trump victory. 4. Stocks covered in Tuesday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Carvana , NXP Semiconductors , Yum! Brands , Palantir , and Dollar Tree . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long DD, ETN, CTRA.

      "\n",
      "Text: Boeing machinists approved a new labor deal Monday, ending a costly seven-week strike that halted most of the company's aircraft production, worsening its mounting losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machinists voted 59% in favor of the new contract, which includes 38% wage increases over four years and other improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The approval is a relief for Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, who took the top job in August to steer the company through its safety and manufacturing crises. The company raised more than $20 billion in a share sale last week to weather its financial problems after warning it will likely burn cash through 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ortberg last month said Boeing will cut 10% of its 170,000 workforce including mangers, executives and employees, to slash costs, with layoff notices going out in mid-November. He painted a picture of a leaner Boeing, focusing on its core commercial and defense businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team. We will only move forward by listening and working together,\" Ortberg said after the contract passed. \"There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Boeing will now be able to resume production, key to its recovery since the bulk of the aircraft price is paid when they are handed over to customers. But getting up to target production rates, particularly for the 737 Max, Boeing's cash cow, will take time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While the strike ending and workers returning to the shopfloor is a meaningful step in the right direction, ramping back up will take time,\" said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein. He said some workers will need to be retrained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The machinists, who build planes such as the bestselling 737 Max, the 777 and 767 aircraft must return to their jobs no later than Nov. 12 the union said. They could return as early as Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yesterday's resolution of the strike was low hanging fruit in our view,\" Jonathan Root, senior vice president at Moody's Ratings, said in a note Tuesday. \"Relieving the impediments to achieving and then sustaining strong positive free cash flow remains the challenge.\"\n",

      "President Joe Biden spoke with union leaders and Boeing's CEO on Tuesday to congratulate them on the deal, the White House said.

      "\n",
      "The new proposal includes 38% general wage increases over four years, up from a previous offer for 35%, bringing the compounding pay increases to close to 44%, the union said Thursday.

      "Text: Electrical components and power systems company Eaton delivered mixed third-quarter results Thursday morning, and its stock paid the price. Revenue increased over 8% year over year (both organic and on a reported basis) to $6.35 billion, slightly below the $6.37 billion the Street was looking for, according to analyst estimates compiled by LSEG. It should be noted, however, that in management's estimation, Hurricane Helene in Florida and the ongoing labor Boeing strike, both temporary issues, were together a roughly $50 million revenue headwind. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 15% to a record $2.84, better than LSEG's $2.80 consensus. Segment margin , similar to an adjusted operating income margin, expanded 76 basis points, to a quarterly record of 24.3%, ahead of the 23.9% estimate. Eaton management raised its full-year guidance for both operating margin and earnings per share (EPS). The company's outlook for the current (fourth) quarter was mixed. ETN YTD mountain Eaton YTD We didn't see anything in Eaton's report or management's outlook for the remainder of the year and into 2025 that causes us to rethink our investment. Given the stock's 34% gain year to date, which has outpaced the S & P 500 's advance, it's not too surprising to see some profit taking on the mixed print. We're keeping our wait-for-a-pullback 2 rating . However, we're increasing our price target to $375 per share from $350, implying over 9% upside from Wednesday's close. Bottom line A major driver for Eaton, central to our investment thesis, is selling products needed to power the build-out of data centers to handle artificial intelligence workloads. If we've learned anything from the megacap cloud providers that have already reported earnings, this demand will continue well into 2025 and should play right into Eaton's hands. Indeed, CFO Oliveri Leonetti said on the post-earnings conference call, \"Electrical backlog benefited from acceleration in order intake from tailwinds of the secular trends, including hyperscale orders within the data center end market.\" Overall profitability was better than expected and top-line momentum continued in the two most consequential segments – Electrical Americas and Electrical Global. Indicative of continued momentum in Electrical Americas, the segment's backlog increased 26% year-over-year, closing out the quarter with a 1.2x book-to-bill ratio. As for the Aerospace segment — despite the sales miss, again largely attributable to the strike – the backlog increased 14% and realizing a 1.1x book-to-bill in the quarter. Operating and free cash flow results were a bit short versus expectations but do represent quarterly records for the company. Eaton Why we own it: Eaton has exposure to several important mega-trends like electrification, energy transition, and infrastructure spending. It is also a player in generative AI, where data centers use its power management solutions to keep up with the heightened demand for more computing power. In North America alone, the company has picked up more than 415 projects valued at more than $1 billion each, $1.2 trillion in total, since January 2021. We see a long runway for growth. Competitors : Parker-Hannifin , DuPont and Honeywell \\ Most recent buy : Aug. 6, 2024 Initiated : Nov. 15, 2023 The effects of the hurricane and the Boeing strike factored into management's fourth-quarter guidance, which came up a tad short in terms of organic sales growth. That said, management was quick to note that these issues are transient and a matter of timing, not demand. In other words, revenue will be pushed out to 2025, not lost, which is why investors will be rewarded for sticking with the stock. We did book some profits in Eaton earlier this week , noting the bar was high going into Thursday's print. Thanks to our sale, we're in a position to view any further pullbacks as possible buying opportunities. We wouldn't be surprised to learn Eaton, in typical fashion, is keeping its outlook conservative — under-promising now so that they can overdeliver and guide higher in the quarters to come. Commentary Looking ahead to next year, data centers should continue to have relentless demand for more power, Aerospace will bounce back once the Boeing strike ends, and everything from commercial buildings to residential homes and vehicles is becoming more electrified. These secular trends are not going away anytime soon. Eaton provided details on North American megaprojects, which management defines as those projects with a value of $1 billion or more. \"Megaproject announcements have accelerated in the past six months with project cancellation rates around 10%, well below historical levels,\" the company said in its earnings press release. In the third quarter, 49 projects were announced, worth over $175 billion, driving further growth in the backlog of planned projects, which now stands at about $1.8 trillion. In total, there are plans for 504 projects on the books. Only 16% of them have started, representing more than $1.7 billion in orders. The company says its contract win rate is nearly 40%. The team is in active negotiations for another $3 billion worth of orders. On the call, CEO Craig Arnold said, \"Taken together, we think they provide a strong validation of the megatrends and support our view on the long-term outlook of our end markets. As we prepare for the growth ahead, we're making investments in our manufacturing capacity naturally.\" Guidance Eaton expects segment operating margins for the full year to land in a range of 23.5% to 23.9%, up from the prior range of 23.3% to 23.7%, and better than the 23.6% consensus, at the midpoint. Adjusted full-year EPS guidance was raised to a range of $10.75 to $10.81, an increase from the prior range of $10.65 and $10.75, and well ahead of the $10.67 estimate at the midpoint. Full-year organic sales growth guidance of 8% to 9% was left unchanged, slightly short of the 8.7% estimate, at the midpoint, as management increased its outlook for Electrical Americas while taking down Aerospace (ongoing strike), Vehicle and eMobility segments. Organic revenue in Q4 is expected to grow 6% to 7%, a miss versus the 8.3% the Street was looking for. Fourth-quarter Segment margin guidance of 23.6% to 24% is ahead of expectations for 23.6%, at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of $2.78 to $2.84 is expected, matching the $2.81 estimate, at the midpoint. 2025 outlook Looking to next year, management didn't provide formal sales or earnings guidance, but they did provide growth assumptions for the company's key end markets. Data centers and distributed IT (17% of total sales), commercial aerospace (9% of sales), and electric vehicle (3% of sales) are expected to see \"strong/double-digit growth\" on a percentage basis. The Utility end market (11% of total sales) is expected to see \"solid growth.\" Industrial facilities (12% of sales), defense aerospace (6% of sales), and commercial and institutional (20% of sales) are expected to realize \"modest growth.\" Residential (6% of sales), machinery (05% of sales), and internal combustion engine light vehicles (4% of sales) are expected to see \"slight growth.\" Commercial vehicles (7% of sales) are expected to \"decline\" in 2025. Put it all together, and the team sees overall 2025 market share growth of roughly 6% to 8%, with an incremental margin contribution of about 30% to 35% thanks to organic growth. Capital spending is expected to be between $900 million and $1 billion. Additionally, the company said that interest, pension, and other corporate expenses are expected to be a 20-cent per-share headwind to earnings. According to a note from Jefferies, the implied EPS guidance range is $11.50 to $12.50 next year, right about in line with expectations. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long EPS.

      "Text: Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Thursday's key moments. 1. Stocks were in the red Thursday, with tech dragging the Nasdaq and S & P 500 lower by 2.4% and 1.6%, respectively, just before noon ET. Both were on track for a second consecutive day of losses. Microsoft was down 5.7% and Meta Platforms was down 3.6% after Wednesday night earnings releases failed to impress Wall Street. The negativity was spilling over to fellow Club names Apple and Amazon , which both report their latest quarterly results after Thursday's close. 2 . Jim Cramer said Thursday that Microsoft shares below $400 each would be an interesting buy level. Microsoft reported a strong quarter but delivered weaker-than-expected guidance . The software and cloud giant forecasted a slight deceleration in Azure growth and continued artificial intelligence spending. Microsoft stock, up around 8.5% year to date, has been the worst performer among our six megacap tech stocks. In contrast, Meta, up 63% year to date , has been second only to Nvidia 's more than 170% jump in 2024. 3. Shares of power management company Eaton fell 5.5% on Thursday after the company reported a small top-line miss in the third quarter. We had an idea the market was going to be unforgiving if the numbers weren't perfect, which was why we preemptively booked some profits on Eaton two days ago. \"If you don't own Eaton, it's not a bad idea to start thinking about it,\" Jim said. Meanwhile, industrial gas company Linde delivered a top-line beat, but conservative guidance pushed shares nearly 3% lower. CEO Sanjiv Lamba will be on \"Mad Money.\" Check email your inboxes and texts later for earnings analysis on both Linde and Eaton. 4. Stocks covered in Thursday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Estee Lauder , SharkNinja , Merck , Bristol Myers , and Uber . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long META, MSFT, ETN, LIN.

      "Title: We upgraded Stanley Black & Decker stock despite the post-earnings selling\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Stanley Black & Decker reported mixed quarterly results before Tuesday's opening bell, and the stock got whacked. While the numbers were disappointing, the company's turnaround continues to plan. Revenue fell 5% year over year to $3.75 billion in the third quarter, shy of the $3.8 billion expected by analysts, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Organically, sales were down 2% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share rose 16% to $1.22, topping LSEG's estimate of $1.05. SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker YTD Shares of Stanley Black & Decker consolidated around an 8% decline after the release. The stock had been down more than 13%, below $90 at the lows of the session. We upgraded Stanley Black & Decker on Tuesday morning back to our buy-equivalent 1 rating on the belief the stock reaction to the print was overdone. Bottom Line While sales missed in both key operating segments, Tools & Outdoor and Industrial, we're more focused on how profitability in each still managed to outpace expectations. Free cash flow came up a bit short but was still more than adequate to support the dividend, continue working down debt, and invest in further growth. CEO Donald Allan said on the post-earnings call, \"We have deployed new investments to stimulate sustainable growth with the primary goal of reinvigorating share gain to achieve organic growth of 2 to 3 times the market over the long term.\" Sales results are a product of end market demand, and we know that's going to be under pressure until the housing market starts to turn. For that to happen, we need to see interest rates – and more specifically mortgage rates – come down to spur demand for both new home buying and renovation projects. The power tools and hand tools needed for homebuilding and fixing up existing homes are made by Stanley Black & Decker whose brands include those namesakes as well as Dewalt for pros and Craftsman for consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield , which influences mortgage rates, has been rising despite the Federal Reserve's jumbo first rate cut of its easing cycle last month and promises of more reductions to come. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings, optimize inventory, streamline and simplify the organization, and transform its supply chain. Although the repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to elevated mortgage rates, management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out, we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch, Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: July 2, 2024 Initiation: June 14, 2023 In the meantime, management is making progress overhauling the company and making it more efficient. When rates do start to drop and investors gain conviction that they are going to stay down, this stock will prove to be a coiled spring thanks to the team's strong execution in the recent quarter on the things they can control. To this point, both gross and operating margins expanded year-over-year and were better than expected. The gross margin expansion was largely attributable to supply chain improvements. \"We are optimistic that the markets will turn in our favor in the future as interest rate cuts in many geographies likely will prove to be an initial catalyst,\" Allan said on the call. \"There will be a lag between lower rates and the flow through to demand for our categories, and we expect choppy markets will extend into the first half of next year until interest rate reductions have a greater effect and the U.S. election result is known and settled. As a short-cycle business, we will plan our production and inventory thoughtfully to ensure we are ready for stronger demand in the future, which could be as early as the second half of 2025.\" We think the market took this to mean a pushout of when demand will improve. The nature of short-cycle business is a quicker turnaround time from manufacturing to product delivery. Management remains on track to achieve its target of $2 billion in pre-tax, run-rate cost savings by the end of 2025. The company cut costs by another $105 million in the third quarter for a total-to-date savings of $1.4 billion. The team is also making good progress toward its 35%+ long-term gross margin target, with 30.5% in Q3 tracking well above the 29.1% gross margin in the first half of the year. Management expects further gross margin expansion in the current (fourth) quarter. Commentary Sales at Tools & Outdoor fell 3% year-over-year, down 2% organic, as a 1% benefit from price actions were more than offset by a 1% currency headwind and a 3% decline in sales volume. Growth in Dewalt, which was up for the sixth consecutive quarter, was more than offset by the weak consumer and DIY backdrop. Geographically, North American sales were down 4% organic, while Europe was up 1% organic, and the rest of the world was up 6% organic. Adjusted segment margin expanded 180 basis points versus the year-ago period, thanks largely to supply chain efficiency gains. We could have seen in even more expansion except that management opted, rightly in our view, to invest in further growth initiatives. Industrial segment sales — largely comprising of fasteners made for end markets such as automotive and aerospace — fell roughly 18%. However, volume was only down 2% while prices were up 1% versus the year ago period — so organically, revenue was only down 1% year over year. The divestiture of the company's Infrastructure business accounted for 17 percentage points of decline. Guidance Management updated its outlook for the remainder of the year, tightening its full-year earnings outlook, now targeting an adjusted EPS range of $3.90 to $4.30 versus a wider range of $3.70 to $4.50 previously. The midpoint, however, remains the same at $4.10, which is short versus expectations of $4.20. The team is expecting a bit less depreciation and lower capital expenditures now versus the guidance provided with the second quarter release, though that will be partially offset by an expectation for higher-than-expected inventory levels at year-end. The midpoint reiterated and not raised on the back of a Q3 earnings beat is likely putting some pressure on the stock because it means that management isn't passing the beat through to guidance. The implication is that the implied current (fourth) quarter guidance is a bit light versus expectations. Full-year free cash flow guidance was reaffirmed at $650 million to $850 million, which at the $750 million midpoint comes up short versus the $818 million estimate.

      "Text: We are selling 185 shares of Best Buy at roughly $89.98 Following the trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 765 shares of BBY, decreasing its weighting to about 2.0% from 2.5%. We're also buying 25 shares of Danaher at roughly $243.21 and 25 shares of Constellation Brands at $236.36. After the trades, we will own 500 shares of Danaher, boosting its weighting to 3.50% from 3.3%, and 425 shares of Constellation Brands, increasing its weighting to 2.90% from 2.70%. We're locking in profits in Best Buy based on a theme developing this earnings season. A handful of stocks started to rally late in the summer on optimism around interest rate cuts, and now many of those companies are giving back gains on underwhelming guidance. We're seeing two good examples in the housing complex Tuesday, with home builder D.R. Horton and Club-owned toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker selling off on their respective reports. Best Buy still has a strong long-term thesis — rooted in a refresh cycle for PCs and other consumer electrics innovations lifting comparable sales back into positive territory — but it also needs existing home sales to pick up again, which would drive purchases of appliances and TVs. With mortgage rates moving in the wrong direction, we want to protect our gains and be ready to buy at lower prices in case there is disappointment when Best Buy itself reports in late November. From this sale, we'll realize a gain of about 10% on stock purchased in March 2024. We're taking the Best Buy sale proceeds to pick up shares in two stocks that have been beaten up post-earnings: Danaher and Constellation Brands. As noted in Monday's Homestretch , Danaher stock last week suffered its worst weekly performance since 2020. The decline looks excessive considering the quality of the company and the nature of the quarter. Danaher reported a much better-than-expected third quarter , featuring a return to core growth in bioprocessing for the first time since late 2022 to early 2023. The bioprocessing recovery has been the main focal point of investors for years, so it was reasonable to think the stock would have rallied after the quarter. In fact, it did in premarket trading, but then it sold off hard during the conference call after management gave conservative commentary about the fourth quarter and 2025. We do not think this is a sign that management is worried about its business. Instead, we see this as executives being their usual, conservative selves. They like to keep expectations reasonable and then beat them. Expectations for 2025 are now much lower than where they were two weeks ago, all while the bioprocessing recovery thesis is intact. That gives us the confidence to make another buy after unloading a total of 125 shares at $269 in July and September. Our first purchase came last Wednesday , the day after earnings. As for Constellation Brands, we are adding to our position on the belief the stock, at roughly 17 times forward earnings, is now a good value. For a company that consistently delivers double-digit earnings growth, that's an attractive multiple to step in. Plus, the market isn't appreciating Constellation's emerging free cash flow growth story. The Corona and Modelo parent is a couple of quarters away from moving past its peak investment phase for brewery capacity expansion. Once Constellation puts that in the rearview mirror, a new phase predicated on returning cash to shareholders will begin. The consensus free cash flow estimate for the current fiscal year is $1.6 billion, according to FactSet. Analysts expect this will grow to about $2 billion in fiscal 2026 and $2.7 billion in fiscal 2027 as capital expenditures plummet. In the future, we expect bigger buybacks and dividend increases. Presidential election risk appears to be an overhang on Constellation stock right now due to concerns about stricter immigration policy and tariffs on goods from Mexico. However, these headwinds may be overblown. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long BBY, STZ and DHR. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

      "Text: Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. 1. Stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors await Big Tech earnings this week. Club names Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices report quarterly results after the bell. Speaking on a panel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Larry Fink, CEO of Club holding BlackRock , predicted Fed interest rates won't be as low as what the market was anticipating. He believes there will be at least 25 basis points of cuts before the end of the year. That would not bode well for several Club stocks that benefit from lower rates including Home Depot , Stanley Black & Decker, Best Buy and TJX . 2. Shares of Stanley Black & Decker were pairing some of their post-earnings losses since the Morning Meeting was recorded — down about 9% now. Jim Cramer called the stock a buy on \"Squawk on the Street.\" He was more tempered during the Morning Meeting. But in the end, Jim thinks Stanley Black & Decker can be bought, and we're upgrading the stock to our 1 rating . Check your email inboxes and texts later for the full earnings analysis. 3. Danaher had a good third quarter last Tuesday, yet the stock has dropped 10% since then. Jim said he wants to buy more shares on weakness. \"There's no better company than Danaher,\" Jim noted, citing management's strong execution. Yet the stock got dinged on lack of 2025 clarity due to low visibility in Chinese stimulus. Danaher has a significant presence in the world's second-largest economy. We upgraded Danaher to our buy-equivalent 1 rating and increased our price target to $305 per share from $295. 4. Stocks covered in Tuesday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Ford , D.R. Horton , VF Corp , Pfizer , and Crocs . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long GOOGL, AMD, HD, SWK, BBY, TJX, DHR. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Stanley Black & Decker stock plunged Tuesday on the company's quarterly earnings release — a move Jim Cramer said investors should capitalize on. Shares of the toolmaker shed nearly 12% Tuesday after third-quarter revenues and its implied fourth-quarter guidance came in lighter than Wall Street expected. Still, Jim described the decline as unwarranted. \"I would buy the stock,\" he said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"I would buy the stock aggressively.\" That's because the quarter was not as rough as the market reaction suggests. \"This was not a bad quarter,\" Jim argued. \"In the conference call, [management] says, 'Look. we don't have the numbers we'd like.'..That's because you need to have some pickup or belief that your house is going to gain value before you decide that you're going to buy the DeWalt, which is the professional, or the Stanley Black & Decker, which is the do-it-yourself.\" Plus, the stock still has a key catalyst on the horizon — the U.S. central bank's loosening monetary policy. As the Federal Reserve continues to lower borrowing costs, activity in the housing market should pickup, boosting demand for Stanley Black & Decker's tools. The bond market in recent weeks has not cooperated with that thesis , but we're not throwing in the towel just yet. \"If you believe the rate cycle is coming, that's the stock to buy,\" Jim added. \"The first trade has not been the right trade.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long SWK.

      "Text: Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Friday's key moments. 1. The S & P 500 is in the green Friday morning, extending Thursday's gains, which ended a three-day losing streak. Big Tech contributed to the rally, and that includes Apple despite a downgrade from KeyBanc that took the stock to underweight from sector weight. KeyBanc cited slow upgrade trends in recent earnings from T-Mobile , AT & T and Verizon as one reason for the call. Jim Cramer acknowledged the iPhone 16 cycle \"has been a yawner\" so far, but encouraged investors to stay invested so they don't miss potential big moves in the stock. We'll hear from the iPhone maker next week when it reports earnings along with its fellow megacap peers including Amazon , Meta , and Alphabet . 2. Dover shares rose more than 1% Friday after reporting a noisy third quarter Thursday that pressured the stock. But Jim said he likes how Dover's repositioned its portfolio to focus on faster-growing markets, such as AI servers and data centers along with the biopharmaceutical industry. \"They've got the best end-markets,\" Jim said. We kept our 1 rating and price target of $200 a share on the stock. The pullback in shares looks like an attractive buying opportunity that we would potentially pounce on if we weren't' restricted. 3. Shares of Honeywell seesawed Friday as investors continue to chew on the industrial conglomerate's disappointing third quarter , which sent the stock down 5% Thursday. The results were hurt by bad execution, energy project delays, and a lack of recovery in industrial automation. The market was also disappointed that the company didn't provide initial framework on 2025. Honeywell is a battleground stock, with reasons to like it and question it. \"So, maybe we hold on, but I've got to tell you, if it gets back to where it was, I've had enough of Honeywell,\" Jim said. 4. Stocks covered in Friday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Tapestry , Western Digital , Colgate-Palmolive , Deckers Outdoor , and Newell Brands .

The S & P 500 moved higher, trying to break a three-session losing streak. Bonds were the difference Thursday as the recent rise in the 10-year Treasury yield took a pause. Mixed economic data didn't really sway expectations for the Fed to cut interest rates by another half-point before year-end. Central bankers started their easing cycle with a jumbo half-point rate reduction in September. The Nasdaq also perked up Thursday, one day after a 1.6% plunge that broke five straight sessions higher. Tesla shares' 17% post-earnings jump was helping tech stocks. Chip stocks were largely higher after semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research 's quarterly beats and stock pop. Advanced Micro Devices rose Thursday after back-to-back down days. Fellow Club chipmaker Nvidia , however, was working a three-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell modestly, under pressure from declines in Club and Dow stock Honeywell following a mixed quarter and a disappointing sales outlook. Dover , another Club industrial name but not a Dow component, also dropped on mixed quarterly results.

      "Boeing 's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, said the company is reviewing its various businesses, laying out a vision for a leaner future at the troubled airplane manufacturer in his first quarterly call with analysts on Wednesday. At the same time, thousands of striking Boeing machinists will vote on a new labor contract, and Ortberg said he was hopeful for a deal. \"We're going through a portfolio process right now to look at the overall portfolio and seeing what do we want to look like five years from now. That may include streamlining certain things,\" Ortberg said in an interview with CNBC's Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday. He added that no decisions have been made yet. \"I think our core business of commercial aircraft and core defense products will always stay with the Boeing Co.\" \"I would rather err on the side of doing less and better than doing more and not doing it well, and I think there are some cases where we can do less and do better,\" he said.\n",

      "Boeing reported a more than $6 billion loss for the third quarter, its largest since 2020 when the pandemic halted most aircraft demand and its bestselling airplane was grounded after two crashes. CFO Brian West said the company will likely continue to burn cash this and next year, pointing to a likely improvement in the second half of 2025. Boeing had originally planned to be cash-flow positive this year. Boeing shares slid during the call, and ended the day down less than 2%. Boeing had released preliminary third-quarter results earlier this month, showing revenue of $17.8 billion, down less than 2% from a year earlier, as well as a loss of $9.97 a share and an operating cash outflow of $1.3 billion. It disclosed charges of more than $5 billion across its commercial and defense units and said it ended the third quarter with $10.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Its commercial airplane unit's losses swelled to more than $4 billion from a $678 million loss a year before. The charges were related to the additional delay of the debut of its 777X wide-body aircraft to 2026 and another delay tied to the 767. Boeing plans to end production of the 767 when orders are fulfilled in 2027.\n",

      "Its defense unit lost $2.4 billion in the third quarter compared with a loss of $924 million in the same period of 2023, with charges tied to several programs, including the KC-46 tanker and the troubled Starliner. The Starliner capsule returned empty from the International Space Station this summer, without the two NASA astronauts it originally carried to space. Ortberg announced the departure of the defense unit's CEO, Ted Colbert, in September. When asked by CNBC about the Starliner problem, Ortberg said, \"My gut reaction is that we've got to improve our systems engineering and our design capabilities so that never happens again.\" Here's what the company reported versus what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG expected: Loss per share: $10.44 adjusted compared with an adjusted loss of $10.52\n",

      "$10.44 adjusted compared with an adjusted loss of $10.52 Revenue: $17.84 billion vs $17.82 billion expected Ortberg, a former CEO of Rockwell Collins, took the helm of Boeing in August, tasked with restoring the company's reputation and stamping out quality problems on aircraft and in other programs. In January, a door plug blew out minutes into an Alaska Airlines flight on a 737 Max 9 after key bolts weren't reinstalled before the plane left Boeing's factory. The near-catastrophe reignited safety concerns from regulators and customers. \"We need to know what's going on, not only with our products, but with our people,\" Ortberg said in prepared remarks Wednesday before the earnings call. \"And most importantly, we need to prevent the festering of issues and work better together to identify, fix, and understand root cause.\" Ortberg acknowledged that it will take some time to turn the ship but was upbeat the company could increase output of its bestselling 737 Max once the strike ends. \"We have employees who are thirsty to get back to the iconic company they know, setting the standards for the products that we deliver,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ortberg earlier this month said Boeing will slash 10% of its global workforce of about 170,000 people, hinting at a slimmer manufacturer.

      "Boeing has already braced investors for a rough quarterly report. Now, new CEO Kelly Ortberg has the chance to share his vision for the troubled manufacturer, from a potential strike-ending labor agreement to a slimmed-down future. When he takes the mic for his first earnings call as Boeing's CEO on Wednesday, more than 32,000 striking machinists will start voting on a new, sweetened contract proposal. Results of the labor vote are expected Wednesday night. Analysts are cautiously optimistic that the new proposal, which requires a simple majority of the vote, could pass, putting an end to the more than five-week work stoppage that has halted most of the company's production of airplanes and added to its cash burn of about $8 billion in the first half of the year. Boeing last posted an annual profit in 2018. \"I think it's going to be a tight vote,\" Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, told CNBC on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "During Boeing's earnings call, investors, analysts and the public could get clues from Ortberg about what Boeing will look like in the coming years as well as clearer estimates on the company's production targets for the next year. Executives at key Boeing suppliers GE Aerospace and RTX told investors on Tuesday that they are looking toward the work stoppage ending with a new agreement. RTX CFO Neil Mitchill said on an earnings call that in the company's Collins unit, commercial aircraft component sales to manufacturers will be flat this year, down from mid-single-digit growth it previously forecast. \"This outlook assumes that we're able to restart some level of shipments to Boeing in the fourth quarter, and we see no change to the long-term structural demand\" for products to plane makers, he said.\n",

      "Ortberg, a longtime aerospace veteran who previously ran Rockwell Collins, took the reins at Boeing in early August. His tall order was to right the ship. The year began with a terrifying midair door plug blowout on one of Boeing's new 737 Max planes after it left the factory without key bolts reinstalled. The near-catastrophe occurred just as the company's leaders were hoping to have regained the trust of regulators years after two deadly crashes killed 346 people, the first of them six years ago this month. Instead, Boeing's rebuilding year is getting pushed to 2025, and Ortberg has hinted at big changes ahead, promising employees and the public greater focus at the 108-year-old company. Earlier this month, he said Boeing will slash 10% of its global workforce, about 170,000 people. \"We need to be clear-eyed about the work we face and realistic about the time it will take to achieve key milestones on the path to recovery,\" he told employees in an Oct. 11 message. \"We also need to focus our resources on performing and innovating in the areas that are core to who we are, rather than spreading ourselves across too many efforts that can often result in underperformance and underinvestment.\"\n",

      "When Ortberg speaks at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, investors will be on the lookout for clues about what a smaller Boeing could look like, and which programs or assets could be on the chopping block. \"We believe [Boeing] is poised for further restructuring as the company looks to potentially divest parts of the portfolio and continues to focus on strengthening its supply chain,\" said RBC analyst Ken Herbert in a note Sunday.\n",

      "Boeing said earlier this month that it will post a nearly $10-per-share loss for the third quarter and report charges of about $5 billion in its defense and commercial businesses, where problems have spanned from manufacturing defects on passenger planes to problems with a refueling tanker and the delay of two 747s that will serve as new Air Force One jets. As it bleeds cash, Boeing last week revealed plans to raise as much as $25 billion in debt or equity or a combination of both. Ratings agencies warned in recent weeks that Boeing could lose its investment-grade rating and the company is planning to increase liquidity.\n",

      "The results of the union vote will come out hours after the earnings call. Meanwhile, the strike is costing Boeing $1 billion a month, according to S&P Global Ratings estimates. Workers had complained that an earlier proposal wasn't enough to combat the skyrocketing cost of living in the Seattle area over the past 16 years since the last contract was signed. In that time, high-paying jobs at technology companies flooded the area, driving up the cost of homes, the union said. The union rejected a previously sweetened offer that Boeing called its \"best and final.\" The new proposal includes 35% raises, compared with the original tentative agreement's 25%, as well as a $7,000 signing bonus, additional 401(k) contributions and other improvements. Boeing also said it remains committed to building its next jetliner in the Puget Sound area, a major sticking point with workers who saw Boeing move 787 Dreamliner production to a nonunion factory in South Carolina.

      "Text: New research from Wall Street analysts missed the mark on two of our industrial-focused stocks. The news on Stanley Black & Decker Baird increased Stanley Black & Decker's price target to $104 per share from $94. That's nearly 2% lower than Friday's close. Analysts cited \"slightly worse trends\" in residential repair and remodeling — a key end market for the maker of power tools. Baird reiterated its hold-equivalent rating on shares, arguing Stanley Black & Decker's \"turnaround progress remains a key focus.\" The stock was down modestly Monday. SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker YTD Big picture Stocks tied to housing like Stanley Black & Decker have been under pressure lately because the 10-year Treasury yield keeps rising despite the Federal Reserve's jumbo 50-basis-point interest rate cut last month and signals of further easing into year-end and beyond. Mortgage rates tend to follow the 10-year yield — so, they haven't dropped, yet. Bottom line The 10-year is \"killing Stanley\" right now, Jim Cramer said Monday. That's because higher-for-longer mortgage rates keep the pressure on housing. But we still expect mortgages to eventually come down as the Fed continues to cut policy rates. That's why we disagree with Baird's call and encourage patience. We have the stock at a 2 rating , with a $115-per-share price target. Stanley Black & Decker \"will be ignited when those [rate cuts] start occurring in earnest,\" he said. \"This is the one hated stock, which I really like.\" The news on DuPont Morgan Stanley hiked DuPont's price target to $94 per share from $88. That implies more than 10% upside from Friday's close. However, analysts did not upgrade the stock — keeping their hold-equivalent rating. They did praise DuPont's forthcoming split into three publicly traded companies, saying the move \"naturally presents additional upside cases.\" In particular, Morgan Stanley cited DuPont's water business as the easiest way to \"envision a valuation uplift.\" Shares of the chemicals giant fell less than 1% on Monday. DD YTD mountain DuPont de Nemours (DD) year-to-date performance Big picture DuPont stock was on a tear after the company announced its spinoff plans in May. Shares then hit multi-year highs back in September, levels not seen since June 2017. Despite the initial excitement, DuPont's spinoff has been viewed as a mixed bag by Wall Street analysts. Barclays, for example, downgraded the stock to a sell-equivalent rating earlier this month. Bottom line Like Morgan Stanley, we agree that DuPont's split will benefit shareholders. But Jim said analysts should have upgraded the stock. \"It should be a buy because the stock is way too cheap,\" Jim said. The Club has a $100-per-share price target on DuPont shares. \"I want to own the soon-to-be-public water and electronics companies, along with classic DuPont. All three will benefit from the separation,\" he added. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long SWK, DD. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Wall Street was lower to start the new week after the S & P 500 closed at a new record high Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield continued to climb Monday, pressuring stocks. In his Sunday column , Jim Cramer wrote about how big money going into S & P funds impacts the overall market. Nvidia , meanwhile, took out its all-time intraday high in early trading. Fellow Club stock Disney fell in Monday's down market after news that board member James Gorman would take over as chairman Jan. 2. The ex- Morgan Stanley CEO , who was already leading Disney's CEO succession committee, said Bob Iger's replacement would be announced in early 2026. Morgan Stanley's research analysts raised their Home Depot price target to $450 per share from $380 — implying 7.5% upside from last Wednesday's record close. Shares fell Monday, extending back-to-back losses. The analysts think the home improvement sector is bottoming and the turn is near. Morgan Stanley said Home Depot's purchase of building products distributor SRS is going well. The analysts also see Home Depot as a big retail winner from technology and artificial intelligence. Honeywell and Alphabet , both Club names, are teaming up to bring Google's Gemini generative AI to the industrial sector. The goal is to leverage Honeywell's massive data set, which can lead to reduced maintenance costs, increased productivity, and opportunities to teach employees new skills.

Honeywell is set to report earnings before Thursday's opening bell.

      "\"The path to autonomy requires assets working harder, people working smarter and processes working more efficiently,\" said Vimal Kapur, Honeywell CEO, in a statement announcing the collaboration, which will begin offering gen AI insights to industrial clients in 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kapur recently told CNBC that the biggest problems AI can solve in an industrial context start with a generational labor shortage, with declining birth rates in the industrialized world resulting in less available workers to do jobs that were popular 25 years ago. \"Everyone has that problem in industrials,\" he said at the recent CNBC Evolve AI Opportunity event.

      "AI-powered agents offered through Google will help automate tasks for engineers and help technicians resolve maintenance issues. Kapur had told CNBC at the recent event that Honeywell will soon be embedding connectivity within jet engines to enable predictive maintenance and reduce time needed for work in shops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honeywell says while gen AI is already being used within the industrials sector, this partnership will take the opportunity to a higher level than current \"gen AI point solutions,\" going \"beyond simple chat and predictions\" by connecting Google AI to the Honeywell Forge IoT platform.\n",

      "Honeywell Forge, an Internet of Things platform that includes information from industrial designs, manuals, and real-world performance of Honeywell products, will leverage Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Google's large language models to build AI agents trained on this data.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he said it's not about the cool features that can be offered to the consumer, who \"gets excited by the writing of a resume or restaurant recommendation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest problems AI can solve at Honeywell start with a generational labor shortage that it and client companies are facing. From pilots to technicians, declining birth rates in the industrialized world have led to less people available to do jobs that were popular 25 years ago. \"Everyone has that problem in industrials,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI opportunity for Honeywell is creating a new labor pool that can learn and work alongside AI and accumulate and deploy institutional knowledge much faster. He said the 15 years of experience traditionally required for a human to handle a complex role can be accomplished at the same level by someone with five years of experience working with two AI co-pilots.\n",

The same goes for smoke detectors, another Honeywell lineup staple, which will be identified for servicing or replacement much earlier than before.\n",

      "\n",
      "If companies gain the most benefit from AI customized to their use cases, that comes alongside a view gaining momentum in discussions of AI regulation that is shifting the focus away from the large language models and towards industry-specific monitoring. And as those use cases proliferate, the C-suite needs to make sure they are being communicated to the board.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's been just over a month since more than 30,000 Boeing machinists walked off the job after overwhelmingly voting down a tentative contract. Costs and tensions have only risen since then. The strike is adding to pressure on Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, who was brought in over the summer to solve the plane maker's various troubles. The strike, which S&P Global Ratings estimates costs Boeing more than $1 billion a month, bookends an already difficult year that started with a near-catastrophic blowout of a 737 Max door plug and comes six years after the first of two fatal Max crashes put the storied manufacturer in constant crisis mode. The union and company remain at an impasse, and airplane production at factories in the Seattle area and other locations has been idled, depriving Boeing of cash. Boeing last week pulled a sweetened contract offer that the union had rejected, saying it wasn't negotiated. Boeing officials had been upbeat to airline customers about getting to a deal in the weeks before the original vote, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. But that optimism didn't pan out, as workers on Sept. 13 voted 95% against an initial tentative labor deal. \"They'll have to increase their offer. There's no doubt about that,\" said Harry Katz, a professor who studies collective bargaining at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. He said one of the union's demands, a return to a pension plan, is unlikely, however, and estimated the strike could last two to five more weeks. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su on Monday was set to meet with the two sides \"to assess the situation and encourage both parties to move forward in the bargaining process,\" a spokeswoman for the Labor Department said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of ending strike has turned more fraught, with federally mediated talks breaking down midweek. Boeing on Thursday said it filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board that accused the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union of negotiating in bad faith and misrepresenting the plane makers' proposals. Late Friday, Jon Holden, president of the striking workers' union, IAM District 751, pushed for a return to negotiations. \"CEO Ortberg has an opportunity to do things differently instead of the same old tired labor relations threats used to intimidate and crush anyone that stands up to them,\" he said in a statement. \"Ultimately, it will be our membership that determines whether any negotiated contract offer is accepted. They want a resolution that is negotiated and addresses their needs.\" Boeing's unionized machinists are not receiving paychecks and lost their company-backed health insurance at the end of September. However, unlike during the last Boeing factory strike in 2008, there is more contract work in the Seattle area to help workers fill the gaps. A union message board posts job opportunities like driving for food delivery services and warehouse work.\n",

      "After the stock market closed Friday, Ortberg said the company plans to cut its global workforce by about 10% \"over coming months,\" including layoffs of executives, managers and employees. He also told staff that Boeing will stop producing commercial 767 freighters when it fulfills its backlog in 2027 and that the delivery of its 777X will be delayed yet another year, to 2026. The surprise cuts came alongside preliminary financial results that showed deepening losses: Boeing said it expects to lose nearly $10 a share for the third quarter and that it will incur charges of about $5 billion in its commercial and defense units. The manufacturer hasn't had an annual profit since 2018. Ortberg faces investors in his first full earnings call as CEO on Oct. 23. \"The thing is once they get 737 production on track all their money problems are gone but they're not willing to settle to make that happen,\" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \"They're firing a lot of people who could make that [stable production] happen. It seems like they're kind of burning down their own house.\" Aboulafia estimated labor in final assembly of an aircraft accounts for about 5% of the airplane's cost. Ortberg is now tasked with drumming up cash and stopping the bleeding as the company's losses mount. Boeing's shares are down almost 43% this year through Monday's close, the steepest drop since 2008.\n",

      "\"We also need to focus our resources on performing and innovating in the areas that are core to who we are, rather than spreading ourselves across too many efforts that can often result in underperformance and underinvestment,\" Ortberg said in a note to staff on Friday. S&P Global Ratings last week warned the company that it was at risk of a downgrade to junk status, as halted production of Boeing's bestselling 737 Max and its 767s and 777s costs the company more than $1 billion per month. The estimate includes previously announced cost cuts like temporary furloughs, a hiring freeze and a halt of most purchase orders for affected aircraft. Boeing is \"facing issues on quality, labor relations, program execution and cash burn, which seem to have created a continuous doom loop cycle,\" said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein in a note Friday. He said Boeing's early financial release on Friday likely points to an equity raise in the works of as much as $15 billion.\n",

      "The U.K. holds dear to its so-called \"special relationship\" with the U.S., priding itself on a long history of shared values and cultural, diplomatic, linguistic and commercial ties with the States. London feels those long-standing bonds and geopolitical interests make its relationship with the U.S., well, special. Whether that feeling of exceptionalism and unique closeness is appreciate or felt as keenly across the Atlantic has always been a bone of contention for London, however, and the bond between the U.S. and U.K. could be tested further when Donald Trump returns to the White House following his election win. In the run-up to the vote, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer had looked to strengthen the relationship with Trump, checking in on the Republican leader after an assassination attempt against him, and traveling to New York with Foreign Secretary David Lammy to dine with him at Trump Tower in September. Congratulating the president-elect on his decisive win, Starmer posted on X that he looked forward to a collaborative partnership with Trump \"As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise,\" he commented, adding, \"From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the U.K.-U.S. special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come.\" Still, Starmer might have some groveling to do with a new Trump administration. Tensions flared last month when Trump's campaign team in October accused the Labour Party of \"blatant foreign interference\" in the presidential election after party activists travelled to the U.S. to help Harris' campaign. Starmer and the party denied the accusations.\n",

      "There's no doubt that the leaders are cut from different cloths — the brash and unpredictable character of businessman-turned-politician Trump is a far cry from the more measured style of the former human rights lawyer who once took on big business in high-profile court cases. Addressing British lawmakers on Wednesday, Starmer reacted to Trump's win by reaffirming his commitment to good relations with the U.S., stating \"it is absolutely crucial that we have a strong relationship, that strong special relationship forged in difficult circumstances, between the U.S. and the U.K.\" But Kemi Badenoch, the new leader of Britain's opposition Conservative Party, which is more ideologically aligned with the Republicans, goaded Starmer over past criticism of Trump by the current Labour foreign minister who, in 2018, called Trump a \"woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath\" and a \"profound threat to the international order\" in a magazine article. Lammy has since said he would work with Trump and would look to persuade the infamously NATO-skeptic Republican to remain in the military alliance.\n",

      "Economists say Britain should not expect any special treatment when a new Trump administration comes into force, but they note it's unlikely the U.K would be a prime target for punitive policies, such as import tariffs, that could be levied on the European Union and China as Trump looks to boost America's growth and competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has already threatened to revive a trade war that began during his first term in office, stating in his election campaign that he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods by 60-100%, and would impose a blanket 10% tariff (or potentially 20%) on all U.S. imports, a move opening up a new front in trade tensions with two of its largest trading partners, the EU and China. The U.K., now outside the European bloc, might find its post-Brexit position an advantage. \"The U.K. is, quite frankly, probably small enough to be off the radar,\" Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, told CNBC after Trump's election win. \"We're not part of the EU anymore. China and the EU are the big two [that will be targeted by Trump]. We won't come into any issues around NATO commitments, because we meet our own. Whereas with Europe, Trump could conceivably say, 'we'll threaten you with a trade war, but if you increase your military spend and meet your NATO commitments, we'll not put tariffs on,'\" Pickering said, noting that \"Trump likes to trade everything off.\" While \"Starmer may have offended Trump at some point, or David Lammy might have offended America,\" Pickering noted that \"these are relatively small potatoes versus Trump's issues with Europe and NATO or China containment. So I think with a bit of careful diplomacy, the U.K. and the U.S. can get on good terms quickly,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so special anymore\n",
      "\n",
      "Describing the \"special relationship\" as one of convenience for the U.S., Pickering said the U.K. could still maneuver itself to be useful to an incoming Trump government. \"The key thing for the U.K. is, can it reassert itself as this mid-Atlantic broker between America and Europe now that it's outside of the EU? This was always the U.K.'s advantage — to be the English speaking common-law, American partner within the European Union, and by brokering that relationship, that allowed us to punch above our weight diplomatically.\" Whisper it, but the \"special relationship\" ceased to be special long ago, according to Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg. \"Apart from strong cooperation on intelligence gathering and few military aspects, all recent U.S. administrations have treated the U.K. as a normal mid-size European country,\" Schmieding told CNBC Wednesday. \"That Trump and Starmer are apparently not fans of each other, to put it mildly, will not help in future U.S.-U.K. talks. But it is not the decisive factor, largely because for the U.S. will probably not be inclined to give any special treatment to any country in Europe,\" he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Text: Bitcoin is on track to hit the $100,000 price milestone by the end of the year after President-elect Donald Trump's election victory, according to analysts. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said a price rise to $100,000 — which would imply 33% upside — \"is possible now,\" as Trump's presidential win and the Republicans' new majority in the Senate is likely to make it easier to push through a \"relaxed anticipated regulatory framework.\" Bitcoin at $100,000 \"doesn't sound so unreasonable\" given it equates to \"just 10% of gold's market share,\" Butterfill told CNBC in emailed comments. Trump, who on Wednesday beat Vice President Kamala Harris to win the 2024 U.S. election, had promised several pro-cryptocurrency initiatives in the months leading up to the vote. BTC.CM= 6M mountain Bitcoin One pledge was to fire Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, who has taken more than 100 actions against crypto firms during his tenure at the helm of the agency. The SEC has sued the likes of crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, and blockchain firm Ripple, which is closely associated with the cryptocurrency XRP, accusing the firms of violating securities laws. Crypto-friendly regulation expected Another promise Trump made was to create a bitcoin reserve holding digital currency the U.S. federal government has amassed from seizing assets from financial criminals. He also committed to boosting the U.S. bitcoin mining sector, saying he wants all remaining bitcoin in the world to be mined in America. CoinShares' Butterfill said that the primary catalysts he sees for bitcoin going forward are a change in leadership at the SEC, crypto-friendly regulation, and further adoption from major corporates. Another thing that could trigger a leg higher is the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates Thursday, he added. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at crypto exchange Bitfinex, said that although it's difficult to predict bitcoin prices, a target of $100,000 in a few months \"doesn't seem too far fetched.\" \"We expect bitcoin to have limited downside now given the bullish impetus, plus fact that we avoided a recession — which at one point looked highly plausible,\" Kooner told CNBC via email. BTC to hit $100K by Trump's inauguration A $100,000 bitcoin price is likely to be reached by the time Trump is inaugurated president on Jan. 20, 2025, according to Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at crypto custodian Copper.co. \"For Bitcoin, it's worth remembering that Trump oversaw not one but two all-time high cycles during his 2016-2020 presidency,\" Aboualfa said in written commentary following news of Trump's election win. However, he added the caveat that those gains \"came against a backdrop of a weakening dollar, unlike the stronger dollar environment today.\" Still, with bitcoin exchange-traded funds currently holding roughly 1.1 million bitcoins, momentum is likely to be positive in the coming months, Aboualfa added. Other catalysts Bitfinex's Kooner added that other catalysts for positive price momentum in bitcoin will include the \"long tail\" of bitcoin's so-called \"halving\" event in April coming through and impacting supply. The bitcoin halving is a technical event in the bitcoin blockchain that happens once every four years. It cuts in half the supply of bitcoin issued to miners who successfully produce new bitcoins. Ongoing expectations of a decline in interest rates, avoidance of recession, and a robust labor market in the U.S. are also likely to \"spur greater adoption and more confidence of the future of bitcoin and its usage in the economy,\" Kooner told CNBC.\n",

      "Text: A ship carries shipping containers through Upper Bay in New York, U.S., September 30, 2024. Caitlin Ochs | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Donald Trump's U.S. election win has left Europe scrabbling to work out how it will be able to contain or counter highly probable tariffs on its exports to the U.S. once the president-elect enters the White House. Ahead of his decisive election win last week, Trump had already threatened to revive a trade war that began during his first term in office, stating in his election campaign that he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods by 60-100%, and would impose a blanket 10% to 20% tariff on all U.S. imports. Trump sees the protectionist move as a way to boost U.S. jobs and growth, but the policy would undoubtedly open up a new front in trade tensions with two of the country's largest trading partners, the EU and China. Critics of the proposed tariffs say the policy could lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Trump has a reputation for unpredictability, meaning his rhetoric sometimes fails to materialize in terms of policy, analysts agree that the president-elect appears undeterred when it comes to trade tariffs, having opined on how the term itself is \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary.\" That leaves Asia and Europe having to quickly consider ways to mitigate the future impact of export tariffs, and whether to retaliate or to try to negotiate a get-out deal. Economists caution that it's uncertain whether Trump's tariffs on Europe will be \"as damaging as feared,\" as ING economists stated in a note last Friday, or whether they will simply be \"a bargaining chip designed to unlock wider foreign policy deals.\" Nonetheless, there have been calls in Europe for the bloc to prepare retaliatory measures now, with the director of Germany's Ifo Center for International Economics calling on Germany — which relies heavily on trade with the U.S., particularly in terms of vehicle exports — and the EU to \"strengthen their position through measures of their own.\" \"These include deeper integration of the EU services market and credible retaliatory measures against the U.S.,\" Ifo's Lisandra Flach said last week. The proposed measures include the potential use of the EU's new \"Anti-Coercion Instrument\" that gives the gives the region a wide range of possible countermeasures when, it says, \"a country refuses to remove the coercion.\" The countermeasures include the imposition of tariffs, restrictions on trade in services and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, and restrictions on access to foreign direct investment and public procurement. Germany and the EU could also strengthen cooperation with individual U.S. states, Flach suggested. But economists also say that the EU could try to use the carrot instead of the stick with the U.S., suggesting there are three other ways Europe might try to stop, limit or avoid Trump's likely tariff policy altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concessions\n",
      "\n",
      "As a starting position with the incoming Republican administration, European policymakers could aim to avoid tariffs altogether, economists note, by offering to boost select American imports in exchange for the U.S. giving it an exemption from tariffs. \"This may include LNG [liquefied natural gas] and soybeans, both of which were part of a deal between Donald Trump and then-president of the [European Commission] Jean-Claude Juncker in July 2018,\" Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note last Friday.\n",

      "Analysts at Eurasia Group, led by Mujtaba Rahman, commented that a \"transactional strategy\" was likely to be pursued first by the European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen. This would see the EU be guided by the goal of bolstering U.S. exports in key sectors such as agriculture, energy (LNG), and defense. \"The EU is likely to pledge to further expand LNG imports from the U.S. Von der Leyen may also explore closing two deals the commission had been negotiating with President Joe Biden, on the Global Arrangement for Sustainable Steel and Aluminium and an EU-US Critical Minerals Agreement. An attempt is also likely to do more via the EU-US Trade and Technology Council, which has helped foster some collaboration on digital issues, such as AI and export controls,\" the analysts at Eurasia Group noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "A geopolitical deal\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, Kenningham said the two sides could strike \"a broader geopolitical deal to try to head off the tariff threat.\" \"The EU could, for example, make a commitment to purchase more defence equipment from the U.S. in order to continue supporting Ukraine — although the EU would find it difficult to agree on how to raise the funds given the staunch opposition of many, including Germany, to more joint EU borrowing.\" A deal is likely to be favorable to European policymakers as they look to limit the economic hit a 10% U.S. tariff would have on European exports. \"The key point is that, while our working assumption is that there is a 10% US tariff which subtracts only 0.2% from euro-zone GDP, the outcome could be less than that if the EU is successful in reaching some kind of deal,\" Kenningham said.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: With the elections over, the ETF world is buzzing about how the Trump presidency will affect the business. How are hopes for tax cuts, fewer regulations and more tariffs influencing what ETFs investors will be buying in 2025? Two corners of the market receiving particular attention are banks and energy. \"ETFs tied to sectors that typically thrive under Republican policies, such as financials and energy, could see increased investor demand,\" Tom Lydon, former vice chairman of VettaFi and an influential figure in the ETF community, said in a recent post. \"For example, during Trump's previous administration, deregulation in the energy sector boosted oil and gas stocks, benefiting energy ETFs.\" John Davi, who uses ETFs extensively as CEO of Astoria Portfolio Advisors, agrees. \"We think the biggest beneficiaries of a red sweep will be in banks, small caps, industrial (cyclicals in general), crypto and the non Mag 7 stocks,\" he told CNBC. Potential Trump ETF beneficiaries Gavi, who also manages several ETFs tied to specific sectors, cited ETFs specializing in banks ( Invesco KBW Bank ETF , or KBWB), smallcaps (iShares Russell 2000 ETF , or IWM), industrials ( Invesco S & P 500 Equal Weight Industrials Portfolio , or RSPN), cyclicals ( AXS Astoria Real Assets ETF , or PPI), Non Mag 7 stocks ( Astoria US Equal Weight Quality Kings ETF , or ROE) and bitcoin ( Bitwise Bitcoin ETF , or BITB), as likely beneficiaries of Trump policies. Matt Bartolini, head of Americas ETF Research at State Street Global Advisors, is especially positive on banks. The SPDR Regional Bank ETF (KRE) received more than $1.3 billion of new investor cash the day after the election, meaning 36% of the fund's current assets came in on a single day. Bartolini said in an an email that the prospect of diminished government oversight is a key driver. \"Lesser regulation on capital controls may increase return on equity for banks, as they may have more relaxed balance sheets in terms of capital hold backs,\" he said. \"At the same time, the other fiscal policies suggest may be inflationary at a time when the Fed is seeking to cut rates. This could lead to steeper yield curves and wider net interest margins, another positive for [profit] growth.\" Though energy ETFs have had outflows this year, that could reverse. \"With the potential for increased permitting around drilling, among other supportive actions and potential subsidies, the firms most exposed to the spot price of oil and its impact on their earnings may benefit,\" Bartolini noted. \"This means broad exposure to oil and gas explorers and producers that feature a mid-and small-cap bias beyond the bellwether giants ( XOP ).\" Don't be surprised to see the ETF industry quickly wrap perceived \"Trump trades\" into a single ETF; several flavor already exist, including the Point Bridge America First ETF (MAGA), the iShares US Manufacturing ETF (MADE) and the Tema American Reshoring ETF (RSHO). Treasury ETFs can be \"tricky\" One area where there is disagreement is Treasuries and bonds in general. There have been notable inflows into large bond ETFs in the past month, particularly the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) and Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF (BND), two of the world's largest bond ETFs, and longer-term funds like iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). However, inflows have been flattish in funds with shorter-dated securities. \"We have been pretty vocal on buying more equities and moving out of [Treasury] bills,\" Gavi said, citing stronger U.S. economic data, a good U.S. earnings season and the Fed's willingness to reduce interest rates to further stimulate an already healthy economy. Edward Rosenberg, managing director and head of ETFs at Texas Capital, described the fixed income ETF market as \"tricky.\" Based on recent moves in fixed income, \"the newly-elected president is creating some worry in the bond market. However, with the fed cutting rates causing short bonds to get a very small bump in price, money markets and the ultra-short bond ETFs could benefit because they could see continual price bumps with each\" rate reduction. Crypto ETFS having big year and getting bigger Since launching in January, crypto ETFs have attracted roughly $70 billion in assets, one of the most successful ETF launches ever. Options have been available since October. Bitcoin ETFs including the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest bitcoin ETF by assets under management, have seen significant inflows since October. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has insisted most crypto currencies are securities that fall under the purview of the SEC, but that may change under a new regime. There will likely be a bigger push for broad legislation in Congress that would give much of the power to regulate crypto to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission instead of the SEC, and more crypto ETFs are likely. \"We have gone through four years of a very very difficult regulatory environment, and that is all about to change,\" Michael Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, a crypto investment firm, said on CNBC last week. Also more likely: a downtick in rulemaking and enforcement cases against crypto companies. Cathie Wood is back One big winner so far has been ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood. Todd Sohn, head of ETFs at Strategas, called Wood's ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) a \"Trump-like proxy.\" ARKK 1M mountain ARK Innovation ETF, 1 month Not only is Tesla her largest holding, but she has also been a beneficiary of the bitcoin rally, since a good part of ARK Innovation is held in Coinbase and Robinhood, which stand to gain from any bitcoin rally. ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK) (largest holdings) Tesla 14.2% Roku 9.4% Coinbase 8.9% Roblox 6.7% Palantir 5.2% Robinhood 4.8% What's still not clear is if Wood can regain the adherents she has lost. Shares outstanding in the flagship ARK Fund have gone from to roughly 120 million today from 208 million at the end of 2022, with only a modest uptick in the past week. Downside risks The downside risks are that \"tariffs and protectionism are inflationary,\" Davi said. That could leave ETFs that track exposure to international markets like China ( iShares MSCI China ETF , or MCHI) and Mexico ( iShares MSCI Mexico ETF , or EWW) vulnerable to selloffs. It could also expose consumer discretionary ETFs ( Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund , or XLY) which rely on imported goods, facing potentially higher costs. Rosenberg at Texas Capital acknowledges that certain ETF sectors, like industrials ( Vanguard Industrials Index Fund ETF , or VIS; iShares U.S. Industrials ETF , or IYJ), \"could be hurt by more tariffs.\" State Street's Bartolini also acknowledges industrials could be hurt by increased tariffs but notes they \"are cyclical and pro-growth. Large U.S. international trade firms would be most impacted. Domestic transportation stocks that can benefit from the re-shoring wave could benefit, however.\" Note: Matt Bartolini, Head of Americas ETF Research at State Street Global Advisors, and John Davi, founder and CEO of Astoria Portfolio Advisors, will be guests on ETF Edge today at 1:15 PM ET.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Cboe Global Markets could benefit from the postelection volatility spike, according to Deutsche Bank. Analyst Brian Bedell upgraded the exchange stock to buy from hold and raised his price target to $222 from $211. This updated forecast represents an approximately 13% upside. Bedell said Cboe should maintain healthy revenue growth into at least 2025. This is supported by his belief \"that equity markets may remain volatile over the intermediate term post the U.S. election results, at least episodically, driving greater use of index & volatility options & futures products.\" Further product innovation and greater adoption of options usage, such as at Robinhood, should also contribute to greater organic revenue growth, Bedell added. \"This includes continued synergistic growth in market data and access fees, for which management believes it can grow by 7% this year, and a 7-10% annual range remains mgmt's expectation over the medium term,\" he elaborated. \"Building on the successful growth of [zero days to expiration] index options (which now account for nearly half of CBOE's SPX index options volume), mgmt. has added a variety of expiries & smaller trading increments, indices and ways to trade volatility.\" The analyst now thinks Cboe could generate revenue growth of 8% in 2025 and 6% in 2026, up from his prior forecast of 6% and 3%, respectively. Stronger revenue growth should eventually enable positive operating leverage, allowing the company to outperform existing expectations of operating margin stability. The analyst pointed out that while Cboe shares have been the worst performing stock in his coverage in the fourth quarter, the company is also the most directly levered to equity market volatility within his exchange coverage. Bedell added that strategic management decisions could also continue to boost shares. \"On expenses, we think mgmt. will be able to moderately slow the pace of expense growth in future years, having mostly built out its global architecture,\" he wrote. \"Operating leverage will likely still be dependent on macro-driven volume growth, though we think mgmt. may try to calibrate expense growth with organic growth, with upside potential from market volatility — which we think will be the case in at least 2025.\" Shares of Cboe are roughly 10% higher on the year.

      "Text: Nvidia is a 'most-own' stock, according to Piper Sandler. The investment firm named the semiconductor giant its top large-cap pick, citing the launch of Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip and lead within artificial intelligence computing. Analyst Harsh Kumar stood by his overweight rating on the stock and raised his price target to $175 from $140. Kumar's updated price forecast is about 19% above where the stock closed Friday. Year to date, shares have soared 198%. NVDA YTD mountain NVDA YTD chart \"Our viewpoint is rooted in the belief that the overall [total addressable market] for AI accelerators will continue to rise in 2025 by ~$70 billion, and we see NVDA well positioned to capture most of the incremental TAM increase while ceding only a small bit to its merchant chip competitors,\" the analyst wrote. AI accelerators are components that make artificial intelligence and machine learning applications more efficient. Capital expenditure trends continue to be favorable at major tech companies, as seen in the latest reports from Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, the analyst said. Kumar thinks that these spending levels could be sustained through 2025. \"We think this clearly benefits NVDA in the near to mid-term future and as such, we are taking our numbers up slightly for the January quarter and subsequent FY26 quarters,\" the analyst added. Additionally, Nvidia's Blackwell chip should become available in the first quarter of next year and could bring in between $5 billion to $8 billion in revenue, Kumar said. \"As supply improves, we see more customers coming on for Blackwell beyond initial hyperscaler adoption in the following April quarter,\" Kumar wrote. \"Given expanded GPU allocations and initial shipments of the Grace Blackwell for inference applications, we are projecting Blackwell architecture revenues could increase to the tune of 200%+ in the April quarter following supply constraints.\"\n",

If that's impressive, consider this: The small-cap Russell 2000 surged 8.57%. The markets have Trump to thank for that. \"Equities are eager to price in Trump's domestic growth policies,\" Barclays strategist Venu Krishna said in a note to clients. That's most evident in the outsized bump in the Russell 2000 compared with other indexes. Smaller companies tend to be more tied to the domestic economy, which is the focus of Trump's pledges. Small-cap companies also have more floating rate debt. With the Fed's 25 basis point rate cut on Thursday, the debt burden on small caps will be reduced, leading to higher profits. The road ahead, however, might not be as smooth. Of the S&P companies that reported this earnings season, 84% beat expectations on profit. But their revenue \"is more subdued, where the proportion of companies beating sales estimates has stayed weak,\" JPMorgan Strategist Mislav Matejka wrote in a Friday note. And corporate financials, fundamentally, are what drive the stock market. The economy could experience some speed bumps too. Policies proposed by Trump, such as higher tariffs and stricter immigration, might decrease growth and increase inflation, or at least slow down the pace of disinflation, said Barclays. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari is also wary of inflation persisting. If tariffs become \"tit for tat,\" Kashkari said in an interview on Sunday, \"that's where it becomes more concerning.\" The Fed, in response to that, could space out its rate cuts even more.

      "Rather than trying to induce a sizeable \"birth spurt,\" China's policies so far have been more about \"supporting families [and] allowing those who do want to have a second or third child to do this with more ease and affordability,\" said Lauren Johnston, associate professor of China Studies Center at the University of Sydney.\n",

      "The \"mental hangover\" from the one-child policy has lingered and \"fundamentally changed young people's perception of families,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, economist at Moody's Analytics.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Shares of Vestas Wind Systems tanked on the news that Donald Trump had won the 2024 presidential election. Investors dumped shares of the world's largest wind turbine maker as Trump has vowed to curtail renewable energy subsidies and favors the oil and gas sector. Other European renewable energy firms, such as wind farm operator Orsted , also fell. However, analysts at a number of investment banks have suggested that investors overreacted to fears of a downturn for the sector. VWDRY 1Y line \"Donald Trump's victory and a republican sweep in Congress is the worst political outcome in the USA for Vestas,\" said Jacob Pedersen, head of stock analysis at Sydbank, a Danish investment bank. \"But this does not necessarily convert into the worst legislation-scenario or the very negative earnings-scenario that the Vestas share reflects right now.\" Pedersen said that any change to the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature policy that offers billions in subsidies for clean energy companies, would not lower revenues for Vestas as it has sufficient orders in the pipeline in the U.S. over the next two years. \"Furthermore, is it likely that fear of changes in legislation can bring forward customers plans and bring new orders forward so Vestas can build an order pipeline through 2026 and into 2027 before we know more about Donald Trump's intentions for change of the IRA,\" Pedersen added in a note to clients on Nov. 5. \"We maintain the Buy recommendation on Vestas.\" And he's not alone — the consensus price target of all analysts covering the stock points to an upside of more than 50%. CEO loads up One investor appearing to heed the analysts' call is the company's CEO. Vestas disclosed on Nov. 6 that chief executive Henrik Andersen had purchased 10,000 shares amounting to about $150,000 on the Nasdaq Copenhagen exchange. Vestas shares are also traded in the U.S. with the ticker VWDRY . Deutsche Bank's analysts John Kim and Gael de-Bray agree that the political sentiment in the United States is \"not supportive\" of Vestas' share price, but suggest that the market's overreaction may have priced in too much of the worst-case scenario. This could offer investors an opportunity, according to the analysts, as shares could rally if the situation is better than forecast. \"We find limited downside from current levels but the shares may not perform short-term due to uncertainty,\" they added. In addition to the political headwinds, Vestas Wind Systems has also had to contend with the rising cost of materials and labor over the past few quarters. That's led to declining margin profits, adding pressure on the stock, which has fallen by more than 50% this year.

      "Text: Investment bank Nomura has screened for Japanese stocks with \"high bitcoin price sensitivity,\" following a surge in the cryptocurrency's price. The bank noted that \"stocks of exchange operators plus semiconductor, IT, and nonferrous names track BTC but are currently lagging.\" It comes as analysts say bitcoin prices could hit $100,000 by the end of the year following President-elect Donald Trump's victory . Year-to-date, the price of bitcoin was up 72.8% to trade around $76,111 on Nov. 8. BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin Trump promised several pro-cryptocurrency initiatives as he campaigned for a second term as president. His \"call for the loosening of regulations on crypto assets naturally has an influence on the price of bitcoin,\" Nomura's analysts noted. The bank said it conducted multiple regression analyses of stocks to identify which have a high bitcoin price sensitivity. It gave each stock a sensitivity of at least 0.1, with a higher number implying it is more sensitive to changes in the price of bitcoin. The stocks come from a range of sectors and \"do not necessarily have any direct connection with bitcoin,\" the analysts explained, with some from \"adjacent industries\" such as semiconductors — which is seeing increased demand as a result of bitcoin mining — and IT. Here are 10 stocks from the investment bank's screen that stand out for having substantial upside potential, according to FactSet's consensus price targets: Top stocks Among the names on the bank's screen are semiconductor equipment manufacturers Micronics Japan and Towa Corporation . According to FactSet, analysts are mostly bullish on both companies. Those covering Micronics give it an average price target of 7,033.33 Japanese yen ($46.05) — indicating almost 83% upside potential. Analysts give Towa Corp an average target price of 3,466.67 Japanese yen, or 67.5% upside potential, according to FactSet. Elsewhere, investment management giant SoftBank Group also turned up on the screen given its focus on — and significant investment in — artificial intelligence. Sixteen of 20 analysts covering the stock give it a buy or overweight rating, according to FactSet, with an average target price of 11,931.20 Japanese yen, implying 29.4% upside potential. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "For countries that could lose their spot on the calendar however, it is acutely political. The Belgian Grand Prix adds an estimated $248 million to the national economy each year. So, when the country's prime minister wrote to Domenicali in late 2023 to lobby for a contract extension beyond 2025, his message was clear: \"The need for you to set up a balanced calendar between Europe, the Far East and America/Middle East will not happen to the detriment of Belgium.\"\n",

      "Text: Temperatures are cooling in Japan, but interest in visiting shows no signs of abating, as autumn arrivals continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. The country welcomed 2.93 million foreign visitors in August, followed by another 2.87 million visitors in September — well above the 2.52 million and 2.27 million who arrived during those same months in 2019, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Historically, Japan sees a lull of tourists in August and September, followed by a bump in visitors in October from travelers in search of fall foliage or Tokyo's storied Halloween celebrations. But this year, that drop is expected to be muted, as the country is experiencing a long-awaited rise in arrivals from Chinese travelers, a trend which began in June. Before the pandemic, China was Japan's largest tourism source market, representing 30% of all arrivals, according to Japanese authorities. Chinese visitors to Japan doubled last month, from 325,645 in September 2023 to 652,300 in September 2024, according to Japan's tourism statistics.\n",

Those from North America and Europe, who travel for longer distances, tend to stay longer, the report stated. Some 40% of those from Europe stay between two and three weeks, it said. By contrast, 75% of South Korean visitors — currently Japan's top tourism source market — stay less than a week. As a result, travelers from North America and Europe spend more on accommodations and food, while Asian tourists spend more on shopping, the report stated. However, favorable exchange rates caused by the weak yen have led to many spending more on retail purchases, a trend most noticeable among Singaporean, American and European visitors, according to Mastercard's report.\n",

      "Young adults in Puerto Rico are on shaky financial ground, a study finds. About 47% of respondents in the U.S. territory are financially fragile, meaning they lack confidence in their ability to absorb a $2,000 economic shock, according to a September report from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Investor Education Foundation. \"This is the first time a study of this nature has been done on Puerto Rico,\" said report co-author Harold Toro. He is also the research director and chair in economic development research at the Center for a New Economy, an economy-focused think tank based on the island. \"It highlights things that people feel and experience, but that are hard to find numbers for,\" Toro said.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than half, or 59%, of adults ages 18 to 29 on the island are financially fragile, compared to 47% of those ages 30 to 54 and 41% of those age 55 or older, FINRA found. The organization in 2021 polled 1,001 adults who live in Puerto Rico. \"The financial fragility and capability more broadly in Puerto Rico … it's pretty dire when we compare it to the mainland United States,\" said report co-author Olivia Valdés, senior researcher at the FINRA Investor Education Foundation. Financial fragility, particularly for young adults, is much higher in Puerto Rico than on the mainland U.S. More than half, or 59%, of 18 to 29-year-olds are financially struggling in Puerto Rico compared to 38% of the same age group in the U.S., according to FINRA data. About 30% of U.S. residents overall were considered financially fragile in 2021, according to FINRA's latest Financial Capability in the United States report, which polled 27,118 U.S. adults in 2021. The Puerto Rico survey was separate, but fielded at the same time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many young adults leave Puerto Rico to try and improve their financial situation, by seeking education or employment in the United States or in other countries. For the young adults who stay, the generation must contend with an economy under recovery, an electric grid hanging on by a thread and sky-high costs for basic needs like housing. Understanding why young Puerto Ricans are financially fragile could help with efforts to retain younger residents and bring working professionals back to the island, experts say. But \"living in Puerto Rico can't just be a matter of survival, it also has to be a place where you can thrive,\" said Fernando Tormos Aponte, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pittsburgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Puerto Ricans are 'having a tougher time'\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, a certain degree of financial strain is typical for people just starting out. Generally speaking, financial standing gets better with age. But financial fragility is more prominent among young adults in Puerto Rico compared to the U.S. \"People who are younger seem to be … having a tougher time,\" Toro said. Adults age 18 to 29 in Puerto Rico are less likely than adults ages 30 and over to report having emergency and retirement savings, FINRA found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Less than a quarter, 22%, of 18- to 34-year-olds in Puerto Rico have any type of retirement account. Among that age group on the mainland U.S., 43% do, according to the broader FINRA analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young adults in Puerto Rico are also more likely than older residents to have student loan and medical debt.\n",

      "Puerto Rico's economy \"is doing quite well,\" said Vicente Feliciano, founder and president of Advantage Business Consulting, a market analysis and business consulting firm in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The job market has improved, and salaries are growing at a faster pace than inflation, thanks to the increase in minimum wage, Feliciano said. While the federal minimum wage in the U.S. is $7.25, it's $10.50 in Puerto Rico.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employment in the private sector was at a 15-year high since mid- 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Still, the median household income on the island was just $25,621 in 2023, less than a third of the $80,610 median household income in the mainland U.S., per Census data. Even though the last couple of years have been better, for adults under 40 in Puerto Rico, \"most of their working lives have been overshadowed by the depression that Puerto Rico fell through from 2006 through 2015,\" Feliciano said. \"The younger generation has experienced financial strain for over two decades,\" he said. \"They have seen many of their friends leave the country. They are frustrated. They blame the traditional [political] parties for something that may or may not be their fault, but is very real.\"\n",

Candidates are often looking to be close to family or regain the sense of belonging or warmth that comes with being in Puerto Rico, said Miranda. But young workers returning to Puerto Rico may face new financial challenges. \"There's always going to be a certain pay cut,\" as six figure salaries are not as common on the island as they are in the U.S. And \"Puerto Rico is not cheap,\" said Miranda. \"The cost of living … it's real. We cannot miss that.\" The island — like the mainland U.S. — has a housing market that's unaffordable for many residents, and having a car is essential to get around because public transportation services can be unreliable.\n",

Yet, like most Puerto Ricans on the island, he still struggles with regular blackouts and electricity problems. Those send him to his mom's house, where service is more reliable due to her solar panels. \"Blackouts and problems with electricity are quite recurrent,\" said Advantage Business Consulting's Feliciano. \"Electricity is a major distinction between the U.S. and Puerto Rico and it hits the younger generation harder than it hits the wealthier, older generation.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Chinese stocks wrapped up a momentous week marked by a $1.4 trillion debt swap program that fell short of many investors' calls for more direct government support. For many, the reaction among investors only reinforced the need to look at longer-term opportunities in individual stocks that haven't changed. The Ministry of Finance signaled at a closely watched press conference Friday that more fiscal support could come next year , while in the near term it focused on addressing local government debt. The relatively muted measures come as China gears up for heightened trade relations with the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose high tariffs on imported goods. Through it all, the CSI 300 stock index in Shanghair managed to rise nearly 6.6% last week, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rallied 3.2%. Stopping further weakness On a macroeconomic level, China is trying to ensure inflation and employment don't deteriorate further, said Liqian Ren, leader of quantitative investment at WisdomTree. While Ren doesn't expect a return to rapid growth, she is watching how Chinese companies are able to build up their brands and charge a premium, maturing from models that previously competed only on price. \"So I think consumer companies like Anta , I think not many people have understood outside China, but it is really becoming the world's leading sportswear company,\" Ren said. \"I think they are also going to make a global play soon. But not many Americans know about the brand.\" But if Anta continues on its present path, perhaps in 10 years consumers will regard the company the same as \"Adidas or other so called foreign sports brands,\" Ren said. \"That's one thing that I am personally paying attention to.\" Hong Kong-listed Anta sells sportswear under its own brand while owning Fila and high-end brand Descente, among others. The company said in October that Anta-brand retail sales for the third quarter rose by the mid-single digits from a year ago, while that of Fila weakened and other brands surged by as much as 50%. Anta shares are up 18% so far in 2024. China's efforts to rival foreign brands have not diminished, regardless of the slowdown. Baidu is reportedly scheduled Tuesday to release its own artificial intelligence-connected glasses, vying with Meta's RayBans product. Xpeng expansion Electric car startup Xpeng in the past week announced its own humanoid robot , and a new $26,000 car called the P7+ that's already racked up more than 30,000 preorders for deliveries due to start this month. The products are largely only going to be available in China, at least initially. \"For Chinese EVs, the door is now closed, and re-shoring is impractical,\" Macquarie analysts said in a Nov. 7 report. \"Our top pick is XPeng, a China pure play.\" \"XPeng has no exposure to the U.S. market and no current plans to enter the market,\" the analysts said. \"Domestic volume has room to ramp quickly, led by new competitive models like the M03 and P7+. The successful launch of the M03 has helped to alleviate investor concerns about supply chain management and product competitiveness.\" \"Upcoming catalysts, such as the pure-vision ADAS M03 and the launch of a hybrid system car could benefit from domestic confidence/consumption recovery and are unaffected by geopolitical events,\" the Macquarie analysts said. About half of Xpeng's 20,000-plus deliveries in each of the past two months have come from its lower-priced Mona M03 car. In the consumer sector, Macquarie's top pick is Yum China , which operates Pizza Hut and KFC in China. \"YUMC is our top idea in the consumer sector given that it is a pure domestic market play,\" the analysts said. \"The company's strategy shift towards franchisee stores and new store format K COFFEE as well as Pizza Hut WoW would be a secular growth driver, which can decouple from geopolitical risk.\" Yum China has ramped up shareholder return targets to $4.5 billion in 2026 from $3 billion in 2024, they added. Yum China on Nov. 4 reported third-quarter earnings, showing operating profit grew by 15% year-on-year to $371 million. Xpeng is due to release quarterly results on Nov. 19. In the week ahead, internet giants Tencent and Alibaba both report earnings. The central government is scheduled Friday Nov. 15 to release retail sales and industrial data for October. \"You have to be very willing to suffer the negative sentiment to invest in China,\" Ren said. There are often \"long stretch[es] of negative sentiment which really test a person's risk-taking.\" But she also highlighted that Chinese stocks can serve as a hedge to other equity markets. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "Title: These 'Trump trades' are on a roll and analysts see more gains ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Some stocks may be poised for more upside after President-elect Donald Trump's White House victory. Since Trump's win, the market has already seen some major gains. In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S & P 500 posted all-time intraday highs during Friday's trading session, with the blue-chip index topping 44,000 and the broad market index hitting 6,000 for the first time. Stocks in various sectors considered to be beneficiaries also saw gains in the wake of the election, with key names ranging from those in industrials to banks and energy. Those sectors in particular had several winners in the rally following Trump's 2016 win , and analysts believe gains may likewise be in store this time around – especially for energy. \"Based on different approaches to the Energy Transition (ET), we believe a Trump admin would be more favorable to the energy sector and equities,\" Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read told clients this week, adding that a second Trump term that \"constrains\" the ET would benefit refiners, international oil companies (IOCs) and gas exploration and production companies. \"We expect a general deregulatory bent from both executive orders and even with legislation – depending on the outcome of the House.\" Defense stocks could also see some gains, according to Barclays analyst David Strauss. Even with an increasing federal deficit, he expects the defense budget to continue to increase under a Trump administration, a move that he said should be \"broadly supportive\" of defense and government services. \"We ultimately think a broad government fiscal reform program could be positive for defense, likely freeing up more funding to be put towards weapons development and procurement,\" the analyst wrote in a note to clients this week. Semiconductor stocks, which responded favorably to the election outcome, may also continue to benefit, even with Trump's hardline tariff strategy. The former president has signaled implementing sweeping tariffs, suggesting that he would propose 10% to 20% tariffs on all U.S. imports and tariffs of at least 60% on goods from China. Notably, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso believes that these tariffs will likely have a \"minimal impact\" on semis, given that only a minority of them are shipped to the U.S. He also notes that there likely won't be much more done in terms of restrictions for those companies tied to artificial intelligence. In light of this, CNBC Pro screened for stocks that have rallied after both of Trump's election wins and may still see more upside based on the following criteria: Saw at least a 10% gain from Nov. 7, 2016, to the end of that year after Trump's first win Saw at least a 2% gain on Wednesday after Trump's second win Are expected to see another 15% gain from here among analysts Below is the full list of stocks that made the cut. In the energy space, Texas-based oil company ConocoPhillips could be a major beneficiary of Trump's policies, including the expansion of drilling projects . While it hasn't been a great year for the stock — it's down nearly 4% year to date — it rose 4% on Wednesday after the election's result. Looking ahead, analysts expect ConocoPhillips to see more than 20% upside. That would be above the 14.2% rally the stock saw after Trump's first win from Nov. 7, 2016, until year's end. On the whole, Wall Street is majorly bullish on the name, as 21 of the 27 analysts covering it have a strong buy or buy rating. The remaining six analysts have taken a neutral stance. Defense company Huntington Ingalls is a standout stock. In Wednesday's session following Trump's second win, the industrial name advanced more than 5%, and analysts forecast about 16% upside to go. In 2016, it surged nearly 24% following Trump's first win until year-end. However, the Street is still largely neutral on the stock. Among the 15 analysts covering it, 11 have a hold rating, while only two have a strong buy or buy rating. The stock has also had a rough year, plummeting about 22%. Chip giant Advanced Micro Devices is a high-beta stock that could also benefit from a possible extension of the bull market and Trump's tax cuts. The stock rallied more than 2% on Wednesday after Trump's second win. Analysts – most of whom are bullish, with 43 of the 52 covering it having a strong buy or buy rating – see an average of more than 24% upside ahead. That would follow a monster rally after Trump's first win, which saw the stock gain almost 63% from Nov. 7, 2016, until the end of that year. While the stock has been marginally higher this year, it's plunged more than 14% over the past one month.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Profound change swept across the electoral map on its way to upending Washington, DC, last week. But how much has truly changed for economic and investment conditions? In the last-minute anticipation and then immediate reaction to Donald Trump's victory on Tuesday, nearly everything broke in favor of risk markets. A quick and decisive election result instantly released pent-up tension over the chance of a hung outcome. The apparent likelihood of a Republican sweep in Congress then engaged the old 2016 Trump Trade playbook of grabbing for cyclical, small-cap and financial stocks. The S & P 500's eventual 4.7% jump for the week after briefly peeping above the 6000 threshold on Friday was almost perfectly set up by the market's three-week internal digestion of the autumn rally, giving the average stock a chance to pull back even as the S & P 500 stayed just below record levels. Almost as an afterthought, the Federal Reserve trimmed short-term rates another quarter-point and Chair Jay Powell did nothing to downplay the chances of a further cut in six weeks. This in an economy that has been surprising to the upside and with inflation readings whose long retreat has paused a bit above the 2% Fed target. Even what looked like a reflex of tighter financial conditions lacked bite. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly shot above 4.4% Wednesday, but even this was below the springtime highs and is at a level that has not been shown to hold the economy back much. Ditto for the dollar index, popping but still below mid-year highs. It's about as much bullish fodder as investors might dare ask for — and more than most bears would choose to fight, at least just yet. But, as ever, there are nuances and potential complications to consider. 2016 Trump redux? For one, the market was already in a sturdy uptrend, the S & P ahead by 20% in 2024 by October. Cyclicals have been consistently outperforming defensive stocks, with financials running ahead of tech since August. Even the small-cap Russell 2000 had made up more than half its year-to-date deficit against the Nasdaq 100 between mid-July and mid-October, once the Fed pivoted assertively toward rate cuts. .SPX .RUT YTD mountain S & P 500 vs. Russell 2000, YTD Leuthold Group chief investment officer Doug Ramsey recited a few of the crucial distinctions between November 2016 and the current moment: \"Core inflation was just 2% when he won in 2016, and few feared any inflationary impact from tariffs. Today, core inflation is 3.3%. In 2016, the federal deficit of 3.0% of GDP was large, but not seen as an impediment to either steady growth in government or a big corporate tax cut.\" The deficit now exceeds 6% of GDP. He adds, \"While the investor mood before the 2016 vote was restrained, one component of our Sentiment Composite (consumer expectations for stock price gains in the coming 12 months) surged to an all-time high just one-month ago.\" The S & P 500 before the 2016 election was at the same level as 18 months before and traded at 17-times earnings, with profit margins depressed after the 2015-'16 earnings recession. Now, the S & P is up 44% in the past 18 months and the P/E is above 22 on more elevated margins. The U.S. economy had been struggling with subpar growth and undershooting the 2% inflation target for more than half a decade by the 2016 election. Today we're coming off an inflation shock with above-trend real GDP the rule for the past three years. Investment-grade corporate credit spreads then were twice as wide as now, leaving less room for improvement in financial conditions from here. In other words, when the reflationary Trump 1.0 policy mix of tax cuts and deregulation came into view following his surprise 2016 win, reflating was exactly what the economy needed. Now, expansionary policy (setting aside possible stiff tariffs and disruptive deportation programs for now) presents itself as a possible accelerant to trends well underway. Even then, value stocks and small caps only outperformed for about two months before growth stocks and defensive sectors took hold of the S & P 500 through a remarkably calm and strong 2017. Here's the S & P 500 Value vs Growth relationship since 2014. As for small-caps, institutional players have been maneuvering to play a revival for the past couple of months, leaving positioning in Russell 2000 futures pretty elevated. Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert regularly computes the five-year profit-growth rate priced into equities at a given valuation, and on Friday said that with the election week rally, \"Our implied growth estimate moved to 13.6% [per year] from 12.4%.\" Chronert calculates that this move \"fully prices a domestic-producers tax cut to 15%, which by our math is a +0.6% annualized FCF impact. That leaves the remaining +0.6% to deregulation and household tax cuts. This creates little room for incremental negatives from tariffs and/or higher rates tied deficit concerns, especially against a euphoric sentiment backdrop.\" His call is for investors to fade any near-term rally that takes the S & P above his 6100 \"bull case\" target for year end. Tesla's 30% week All fair and sober assessments. Yet even if the math pencils out to an unexciting fundamental return setup, bull markets also feed off of stories and feelings and the fund flows they embolden. If the reflationary policy prescription today is not needed to cure an impaired economy, perhaps it will be used by markets for recreational purposes? Certainly, this might have been previewed in the way that crowd favorite Tesla burst about 30% higher for the week, the way heavily shorted stocks were ripping, the vertical ascents in the likes of Goldman Sachs shares on expectations of a merger and IPO frenzy to be unleashed. TSLA 5D mountain Tesla, 5 days More concretely, the mere hope of a possible corporate tax cut and of industry empowered to tilt regulations more in their favor can sustain the feeling that earnings growth can improve by late next year and perhaps lengthen an economic cycle that not long ago seemed to be losing momentum. For sure, the S & P 500 is by some measures running a bit hot, pushing above the top end of its two-year bull-market path. This simultaneously means a pullback should be unsurprising but an ultimate peak isn't likely at hand. Market breadth was also pretty underwhelming all week for such a strong index rally, a sign of how assertively the market took to sorting deemed policy winners from the rest of the pack. Investors had pared back exposures and hedged pretty aggressively into the election, so there is likely still room for the Street to \"re-risk\" portfolios further. Still, after the bounty of market-friendly news, it's time to watch for investor sentiment and positioning to grow toward unstable bullish extremes — even if, near year's end, such readings are not always much impediment to the upward seasonal bias.\n",

      "\n",
      "Text: Inflation data in the week ahead could determine whether a stock market that surged to all-time highs after Donald Trump 's decisive victory can continue to push higher. The October consumer and producer prices data are set to release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates this week by a quarter percentage point in what was a widely anticipated move. A cooler inflation print that confirms the central bank can continue its easing cycle will support a stock market that's been on a tear, in part because of stabilizing prices and a somewhat softening labor market. On the other hand, a hotter number that threatens that narrative could upend those gains. \"One of the legs of the stool that the market sits on right now at this level is the fact that the Fed is cutting rates,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. \"And I would certainly say anything that changes that opinion could certainly tip the apple cart over.\" .SPX 5D mountain S & P 500, over five days For the moment, investors are optimistic the Fed is on pace to get back to neutral, meaning the Fed funds target rate will return to a level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary for the economy. Markets are currently pricing in a 64% likelihood the Fed will lower rates by another quarter point in December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . The overnight lending rate is expected to end 2025 somewhere between 3.5% and 4%, down from the 4.5% to 4.75% range where it sits currently. Key inflation When it comes to economist projections, at least, the consumer price index, or CPI, next week should give investors little reason to change their outlook on interest rates, though concerns linger. The October CPI is expected to have risen 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, the same as in the prior month, according to economists polled by FactSet. On a yearly basis, it's expected to have ticked higher by 2.5%, up from 2.4% in the previous reading. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have held steady at 0.3% and 3.3% on a monthly and yearly basis, respectively. Meanwhile, the October producer price index, which excludes shelter, is set to have risen 0.3%, consensus estimates show, up from a 0.0% reading the prior month. On a yearly basis, it's expected to have risen by 2.3%, up from 1.8% previously. \"We've been concerned that inflation is sticky, and likely to creep back up due to base effects and shelter,\" said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments. \"And I think that's because the market expects for interest rates to be higher for longer.\" 'Trump trade' Of course, there seems to be little that can get in the way of the equity rally as of late, with the \"Trump trade\" leading to investor euphoria in broad swaths of the market. This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 44,000 for the first time ever , while the S & P 500 did the same, briefly crossing 6,000 to its own milestone. The Nasdaq Composite also notched an intraday record. Financial stocks have surged on promises of lower corporate taxes, as did stocks in the biotech sector that could see a rise in merger and acquisition activity. Bitcoin surged , gold faltered . Small caps rallied . Oil stocks rebounded, and renewable energy tumbled. China-exposed stocks dropped. Even with this surge, many investors continue to be bullish on the market because of a strong fundamental backdrop. Investors are wrapping up an upbeat third-quarter reporting season, with roughly 74% of the 450 S & P 500 companies that have reported thus far posting positive surprises, according to FactSet data. The U.S. economy is robust, with the Atlanta Fed projecting real GDP growth of 2.5% in the fourth quarter. Markets even absorbed a surge in bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield appearing to calm down at the tail end of this week, below 4.5%. US10Y 5D mountain U.S. 10-year Treasury yield Even so, there are concerns, including a lack of clarity yet on the control of Congress, which could determine whether tax cuts will be extended past 2025. Investors are also considering whether the tariffs proposed by the president-elect could be inflationary, and if the promise of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants will hurt domestic productivity. \"For the time being, it appears as if the markets have been able to sort of focus on the positive implications of this new administration,\" Hogan said, and \"whistle by the grave on the potential negatives.\" Week ahead calendar All times ET.

      "Finance Minister Rachel Reeves on Wednesday hiked capital gains tax (CGT) — a levy on the profit investors make from the sale of an investment — as part of her far-reaching budget announcement. The lower capital gains tax rate will be increased to 18% from 10%, while the higher rate will climb to 24% from 20%, Reeves said. The tax hikes are expected to bring in £2.5 billion.\n",

      "\"We need to drive growth, promote entrepreneurship and support wealth creation, while raising the revenue required to fund our public services and restore our public finances,\" Reeves said, adding that, even with the higher rate, the U.K. would \"still have the lowest capital-gains tax rate of any European G7 economy.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "However, she added that the rate of CGT applied to entrepreneurs selling all or part of their business under BADR will be increased to 14% in 2025 and 18% a year later. She stressed that this still represented a \"significant gap compared to the higher rate of capital gains tax.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Britain's Labour government appears poised to raise \"sin taxes\" in its highly anticipated October budget as it seeks to cash-in on lucrative industries to bolster Treasury revenues. U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is scheduled to deliver the government's budget on Wednesday afternoon, bringing an end to months of speculation about how hard Labour's measures will hit \"working people\" and the extent to which the government intends to borrow to support long-term investment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned it's time for the world's sixth-largest economy to \"embrace the harsh light of fiscal reality\" and run toward \"tough decisions\" to avoid getting stuck on a downward trajectory. Among a litany of measures, including a major change to the government's fiscal rules, Reeves is reported to be considering a sin tax raid. These levies, which are regularly hiked in government budgets, commonly refer to taxes on harmful goods such as alcohol and cigarettes, as well as the gambling sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the government might view them as low-hanging fruit in terms of no-one coming to defend them, but you do have to be wary of killing the golden goose at the same time. Michael Field Europe market strategist at Morningstar\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts say that while sin taxes will likely play a significant role in the budget by raising billions of pounds in revenue, they alone will not be able to plug what has been described as a \"black hole\" in the country's public finances. \"Sin stocks are a good place to start. One would assume that they have already been taxed into oblivion but there is always the opportunity to rinse them a little bit more,\" Michael Field, Europe market strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC via video call. \"I think the government might view them as low-hanging fruit in terms of no-one coming to defend them, but you do have to be wary of killing the golden goose at the same time — and the ramifications for a black market if indeed the industry becomes not profitable to operate in a law-abiding manner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What's on the table?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the sin industries that may be in Labour's crosshairs is the gambling sector. The Guardian reported on Oct. 11, citing unnamed sources familiar with the discussions, that the Treasury is considering fresh levies that could raise between £900 million ($1.17 billion) and £3 billion. Shares of London-listed gambling stocks fell sharply on the news. Britain's Entain, which owns brands such as Ladbrokes and Coral, closed around 8% lower on Oct. 14, while William Hill-owner Evoke fell over 14%. U.S.-listed Flutter , which owns Betfair and Paddy Power and has a primary listing in London, also tumbled following the report.\n",

      "Separately, the Labour government is said to be contemplating a move to increase the tax on vaping products alongside an increase in tobacco duty. The U.K. government announced last week that it intends to ban the sale of disposable vapes in England from next summer. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said on Thursday that vape usage soared by more than 400% between 2012 and 2023, noting that 9.1% of the British public currently use these products. Asked about the prospect of sin taxes in the budget, a Treasury spokesperson told CNBC: \"We do not comment on speculation around tax changes outside of fiscal events.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bruce Morley, economics and finance lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Bath, said sin industries were likely to be targeted in Wednesday's budget, adding that such a move would probably receive broad public support and, ultimately, raise billions in tax revenue. The gambling sector \"could potentially be a prime target,\" Morley said, while higher taxes on tobacco products, including vaping, would benefit both tax revenues and public health. \"At the moment, vaping only receives the standard 20% VAT rate but, unlike tobacco, no individual levy. This could change in the budget, especially following the concerns over the [effects] of vaping on the health of the young,\" Morley told CNBC via email. \"However, the amounts raised by taxing the sin products won't be enough to cover the amounts the government wishes to raise, so other less popular taxes will also have to rise substantially,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could it mean for stocks?\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked how a move to target the gambling and tobacco sectors with higher taxes could impact stocks, Morningstar's Field said that some of the negativity had already been priced in to some degree, particularly given the intense speculation of what might feature in Wednesday's budget. For tobacco giants such as Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco , Field said that the price of these stocks appeared to have been \"quite beaten up relative to where we think they should be worth, but at the same time, I think the market is still a bit skeptical about the regulatory environment around vapes.\"\n",

Es Con Field Hokkaido is a stadium on the Japanese island of Hokkaido with a grass field, retractable roof and space for 35,000 spectators. But the grand slam for fans is the stadium's hotel, which comes with rooms overlooking the field where the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters play. The Fighters are the former team of Major League Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani. Opened in March 2023, the stadium is home to the Tower Eleven Hotel, which has eight themed rooms with field views, including the Clubhouse Room, which resembles the Fighters' locker room and comes with original lockers from the Sapporo Dome, the team's old stadium. Travelers who stay here might be storing their pajamas in the same locker that Ohtani once used. Guests don't need tickets to the game, since they can watch it from their rooms.\n",

Developers dug 4,265 feet into the ground to reach the water, according to HKS Architects, the Dallas-based company that designed the stadium. There's a cold plunge pool too, alongside a bar where guests can order craft beer and edamame.\n",

There's good reason for this: You may end up on the Jumbotron. Throughout the onsen area, baseball-themed details abound. Guests hang towels from the ends of sawed-off bats, previously used by Hokkaido Fighters players. There's also a sauna, with railings that are shaped like bats. The check-in desk encases dozens of game-used baseballs, and the area is decorated with diamond-shaped tables.\n",

In total, the Fighters have won three Japan Series titles, most recently in 2016. The Fighters' schedule mirrors that of Major League Baseball, with regular season games running from March to September. Attending a game is a wonderful window into Japanese culture.

Search interest for \"Travel Tuesday\" rose more than 500% from 2021 to 2023, according to a report published by McKinsey & Company on Thursday.

But Mann cautions that Travel Tuesday may not do for the travel industry what Black Friday has done for retail. On both dates, consumers are looking for the best deals, he said. \"But unlike some of the impulse purchases consumers make on Black Friday, travel bookings can require more planning.\" For those who are ready to book, they can find discounts on airfares, cruises and tour packages, with many hotels offering 20-30% off best available rates. Travelers can check out \"Travel Tuesday\" deals from 2023 to get an idea of what to expect this year.\n",

A day earmarked for travel discounts can be a win for travelers and an opportunity for companies to bolster revenue during a period when there's usually a lull in bookings, according to McKinsey. Late November/early December is often considered too late for winter bookings and too early for summer ones, the report states.\n",

      "Title: At the SEC, Trump's election victory paves the way for a rollback in regulations\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Corporate America now has a big chance to roll back regulations. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has sought to dramatically increase regulation of corporate America, vastly increasing disclosure requirements in particular. In response, corporate America has brought an avalanche of lawsuits against Gensler and the SEC. With a new regime now coming into the SEC following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential race, how will they respond to the lawsuits? What will the new leadership at the SEC look like? CNBC spoke with Larry Tabb, director of market structure research at Bloomberg Intelligence. The questions have been edited for brevity and clarity. With the election over, what will happen to the leadership of the SEC? Gary Gensler's chairmanship does not expire until 2026, but it's likely he will step down as chairman. However, Gensler also remains as a commissioner. There is currently three Democrats and two Republicans, but that will likely flip under the Trump administration. Could Gensler stay on as a commissioner? It would be odd, but he could do it. But he would become a regular commissioner, and not only lose control of the agency's agenda but the majority of its people. He would have one vote and a few advisors. Are there are any favorites for SEC chairman? Dan Gallagher, now serving as Robinhood's chief legal officer and formerly a Republican SEC commissioner, has been floated as a possible replacement. Another possibility is one of the current Republican SEC commissioners, Hester Peirce, who has opposed most of the new rulemakings and lawsuits that Gensler has initiated. However, Peirce is an academic who has shown little political ambition and it's unclear if she would even want the job. The other Republican commissioner is Mark Uyeda who has been at the SEC a while, and he may be a choice for either acting chair or chairman. What happens to Gary Gensler's current agenda? There are dozens of pending rules that have yet to be adopted. The incoming chairman controls the staff and the agenda. Gensler's agenda will be put on hold. Gensler still has a majority on the SEC. Is it possible he will try to push through additional rules before he leaves? It's possible, but even here there are limits to what he might be able to do. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn regulations passed in the last portion of a previous administration. What might be the priorities for the incoming SEC chair? That will depend very much on the incoming chairman. There's little doubt a Republican-led SEC will be more sympathetic to crypto. Gensler has said he believes most crypto currencies are securities. I think there will be an attempt to more clearly define which crypto currencies are or are not securities, which would go a long way toward clearing up regulatory uncertainty. There will likely be a bigger push for broad legislation in Congress that would give much of the power to regulate crypto to the CFTC. There may also be an effort to reinvigorate the IPO market. Helping companies become public could be a priority, including an effort to eliminate existing rules which impede capital formation and make investing more expensive. What about all the regulations that the SEC passed under Gensler? Could the new administration undo those regulations? They could, but there is a long process that needs to be followed. Essentially, it is the rule-making process in reverse. They would need to propose to undo the rule, post a notice and comment period, and then vote. The SEC is being sued over dozens of regulations Gensler has enacted, including board diversity, share buybacks, short-sale disclosures, securities loan reporting, registration of Treasury market dealers, climate disclosure, and cybersecurity. Many of them allege that the SEC has overstepped its regulatory authority. What will happen to these lawsuits? The SEC is an independent agency but they have great latitude in deciding how to respond to lawsuits. Most of these suits are still pending in federal court. As soon as a new Republican chairman comes in, I suspect many of these lawsuits will probably not be contested and the regulations will not go into effect. How would that work? In a lawsuit, a corporation is suing the SEC, claiming, for example, that they do not have statutory authority to require more disclosure of some part of their business. The SEC has to respond to the lawsuit. One thing the SEC could do is simply decide not to contest the allegations. The court would then say, in effect, 'Oh so you agree with the suit, you over-reached,' and the court will not allow the regulation to go into effect. Alternatively, they could tell the court they agree that the rule doesn't comply and then say they will go and fix it, but in effect do nothing. I am not sure the SEC would want to publicly back away from rules they proposed and voted on. Any rules in particular the incoming administration might be eager to rescind? Climate change, securities finance/ lending, and I am sure there are others. Are there any other reasons to believe rulemaking will be greatly curtailed under the Trump administration? Yes. The Chevron doctrine was established by the Supreme Court in 1984, it granted deference to a government agency's interpretation of rules, providing they were reasonable. This was overturned this year by the Supreme Court, which held that the Administrative Procedure Act required courts to exercise independent judgement in deciding whether an agency acted within its statutory authority. What is the effect of that ruling? It's still being worked out, but it will likely reduce the power of federal agencies to make rules and increase the role of courts in interpreting those rules. That said, the SEC has not historically relied on Chevron, so this ruling will probably have little impact, but suing the SEC has become very popular, not only by broker, agencies and exchanges but also by the buyside, which is really aggressive for money managers (or their associations). There is little way to put this genie back in the bottle without changing strategy, so you will continue to see many lawsuits, which has and will undermine the authority of the agency. The only way out of this is two-fold: one, take out a big stick and use enforcement to push back on the industry and/or two, go back to the industry and seek consensus. The industry is of course looking for number two, but it may be a combination of both.\n",

      "Title: Here's what usually happens to the S&P 500 during a presidential election week\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: What happens to stocks during election week? In general, the market has a slightly bullish bent during election week, but you can slice it different ways. Since 1928, there have been 24 elections. The average percentage change for the S & P 500 during the week of the election is up 0.7%, with the index gaining 63% of the time, according to Birinyi Associates. However, the last four days of the week (that is, Tuesday to Friday), the S & P is down an average 0.4% and up only 58% of the time. As for Election Day itself, eight of the 10 elections over the past 40 years have been up days, with an average gain of 0.9%, according to CFRA Research (Note: The stock markets were closed on the Tuesday of Election Day prior to 1984). Many find it hard to believe, but with a few exceptions, it has not mattered much which president is in the White House in terms of the stock market. Nasdaq chief economist Phil Mackintosh noted that one key issue in returns is whether there was a recession. The average total return for four-year terms that overlapped with a recession was 30% for the S & P 500, compared to 62% for those that didn't, he said. This was true, regardless of whether there was a Democrat or Republican in the White House. What determines trading for the rest of the year What matters more is what will happen for the rest of the year. That is largely determined by the state of the economy and earnings. Third-quarter earnings have been rising as we get near the end of the reporting season and, more importantly, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to rise more than 10%, led by technology up 14.6%. Analysts have not been significantly cutting those estimates. That is why the S & P 500 is only 2% below its historic high. S & P 500 earnings estimates Q3: +8.4% Oct. 1: +6.0% Q4: +10.7% Technology: +14.6% Source: LSE G Seasonals are important as well The seasonal trend is very strong. Goldman Sachs noted that this begins the best trading period of the year for U.S. equities. There are several reasons for this: Many mutual funds and pensions end their fiscal year Oct. 31 and they are often sellers, and 2) many U.S. corporations can again begin repurchasing stock after a \"blackout\" period for third-quarter earnings. In an election year, there is also a tailwind because the end of the election is a \"clearing event\" for risk assets. You can also add in the other usual suspects: tax-loss harvesting and retail and institutional investing for the new year. Last week, Goldman noted that in election years, the S & P has tended to slightly outperform nonelection years: S & P 500 in the fourth quarter (median return from 10/27 to the end of year, since 1928) All years: +5.2% Presidential election years: +6.25% Source: Goldman Sachs\n",

      "Title: A resilient economy and strong earnings are overpowering normal election worries\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: There's still two months to go in the year, and this is already one of the strangest markets we have seen in a long time. In years when there are presidential elections, and particularly close elections, the market is usually more volatile earlier in the year, and returns are typically slightly lower than in non-election years. Not this year. While volatility has picked up recently, returns on the S & P 500 are far above normal, and it likely has little to do with the economic policies of either candidate. .SPX YTD mountain S & P 500, YTD It's because the economy and earnings remain resilient. Tech earnings in particular are strong and not decreasing. That is the main reason the S & P 500 is less than 2% from its historic high. The election is the big wildcard It's not clear how soon the winner will be announced in the election , and the market is reflecting some of that uncertainty. The market tends to experience higher levels of volatility going into an election, but after the election volatility drops and the market typically rallies into the end of the year. Close elections tend to have even higher levels of volatility, and that is certainly the case with this election. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) , at 22, has remained elevated since the end of the summer, largely on concerns about the election. .VIX YTD mountain CBOE Volatility Index, YTD The VIX curve (the relationship between the shorter-term and long-term prices of VIX futures contracts) is in backwardation: that is, prices for the cash contract and the front-month (November) contract are higher than contracts further out, implying uncertainty not just over who will win, but how long it might take to announce a winner. \"The VIX spot and VIX futures markets are telling us that equities are bracing for a somewhat extended period of volatility,\" Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a recent note to clients. Long-term, it's the economy that matters The economy has been strong, with GDP growth near 3% . That and earnings are the biggest factor in this year's market returns. The overall market returns for this year are highly unusual: 1) the return YTD of 20% on the S & P 500 is well above the average yearly return of roughly 9% (not including dividends) and 2) return in election years, particularly when the race is close, tend to be lower because election uncertainty weighs on the market. Nasdaq Chief Economist Phil Mackintosh noted in a recent blog post that while returns for the S & P 500 typically average 9% in non-election years, the returns are typically 3% in election years, much of that done after the election is held. Obviously, the returns are far above what would historically be expected. How to account for this? \"Perhaps what this shows is that, regardless of what happens in an election year, macroeconomics matters,\" Mackintosh concluded. Mackintosh noted that one key issue in returns is whether there was a recession. He noted the average total return for four-year terms that overlapped with a recession was 30% for the S & P 500, compared to 62% for those that didn't. This was true, regardless of whether there was a Democrat or Republican in the White House. \"So, much more than who's in the White House, it's the economy that matters to markets,\" Mackintosh concluded. Earnings have been strong Two-thirds of the way through earnings season, and the aggregate numbers are strong. The third quarter is exhibiting a typical pattern: overall earnings come down a couple percentage points going into the quarter (this happens because analysts are always overly bullish and adjust expectations downward as they have better visibility), than estimates rise as companies begin to report and beat estimates. Third quarter earnings for the S & P 500 are up 8.4%, well above the 6.0% estimated at the start of October. 77.1% of the companies have beat analyst expectations (above the long-term historic average of 67%) and most importantly, companies are beating estimates by a wider margin than usual: 7.8% above expectations versus a long-term (since 1994) average of 4.2% above estimates. Much of this is being driven by technology. The sector is expected to grow 19.1% in the third quarter and estimates have been rising. It's fourth quarter earnings that matter Remember, the most important thing to watch is the trend and whether it is accelerating or decelerating. Are earnings growing or are they shrinking; if they are growing, is the pace of growth accelerating or decelerating? For the fourth quarter, analysts are not cutting estimates any more than the historic average. John Butters, an earnings analyst at FactSet, noted that overall earnings for the fourth quarter dropped 1.8% in the month of October, which is exactly in-line with the 10-year historic trend of a drop of 1.8%. In the case of the technology sector, estimates for the fourth quarter have declined a modest 0.9% since the fourth quarter started October 1, not statistically significant. Most importantly, technology earnings have been growing in the mid-single digits for over a year for every quarter, and are estimated to keep up that pace well into next year. This is what is powering the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq higher. S & P 500 Technology earnings: double digit gains every quarter (rounded) Q1 up 27% Q2 up 21% Q3 up 19% (est.) Q4 up 15% (est.) Q1 '25 up 18% (est.) Q2 up 21% (est.) Q3 up 19% (est.) Source: LSEG There has been some disappointment with a small handful of tech stocks, but much of it has been tied to CEOs offering conservative guidance. However, Scott Chronert at Citigroup noted this was not unusual: \"There has been some conservatism in guides, which, to us, should be expected given an upcoming election and stocks near/at all-time highs,\" he told clients in a recent report. Not surprisingly, there are some pockets of weakness. With oil prices dropping analysts have been lowering estimates for energy companies rather aggressively: earnings have been cut 8.5% since October 1st. The biggest problem for stocks The economic data may be reasonably strong, and inflation may be trending down, but rising bond yields indicate to many that high debt levels are going to be an issue no matter who wins. \"You don't want the bond vigilantes to control the market,\" Alec Young at MapSignals.com told me. \"Much of the rally is based on reasonably low rates, if that gets out of control, it's going to be a problem.\" The other major issue: The market is expensive on an historic basis, trading at 22 times forward earnings estimates, well above historic norms of roughly 17-18 times. The combination of higher rates and high valuations has made it tough for the market to continue to advance. \"There has been a change in tone,\" Young told me. \"We're not going up anymore. The market was at this level in mid-September. It's a choppy, consolidating, sideways market, before it was making new highs on a weekly basis.\" That is certainly understandable. This is a two-year old bull market. The S & P 500 is up 50% in those two years. That is quite a run, far above historic norms. The Street is certainly expecting a post-election rally no matter who wins, but maybe the safer course is just to be happy with the gains so far.\n",

      "The New York Stock Exchange, owned by Intercontinental Exchange , wants to do trading 22 hours a day during the week. Is that good for the markets? The Big Board announced on Friday that it was seeking approval to expand trading on its electronic Arca platform from 16 hours a day to 22 hours a day (pausing between 11:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. ET) from Monday to Friday, subject to regulatory approval. NYSA Arca currently has a pre-opening session from 4:00-9:30 AM ET. \"Core\" trading hours for both the NYSE floor and NYSE Arca are 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET. NYSE Arca then has a late trading session from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET.

      "The NYSE thinks so \"Interest in U.S. equities from both retail and institutional investors continues to grow, both in the U.S. and globally,\" Kevin Tyrrell, head of markets at NYSE, told CNBC in an interview on Friday. Tyrrell, declined to provide more specific details on where the demand was coming from and declined to provide details on a survey NYSE did of its members on expanding trading hours. \"Our 22-5 [22 hours a day, 5 days a week] extended trading plan is based on numerous interactions with market participants as well as our own data and analysis,\" Tyrrell, said. \"We believe our 22-5 extended plan is the right approach given current levels of investor demand and availability of current market infrastructure.\" Jim Toes, CEO of the Security Traders Association, an industry group, told CNBC the application \"seems very premature as the demand by investors for overnight and weekend exchange trading is speculative.\" However, Dmitri Galinov, who formerly ran Credit Suisse's dark pool, disagrees. \"There is definitely demand from overseas, particularly South Korea, Japan, and some demand in Europe,\" he told CNBC in an interview on Sunday. \"In addition, there are retail traders in the U.S. who want to trade at night. Many retail traders work during the day, they come home and want to trade beyond the 8 p.m. cutoff for trading.\" What about institutional traders? Do they relish trading on thin volumes? \"The institutions will not be the first movers, but as the volume migrates to a 24-hour curve, the institutions will come,\" he told CNBC. What about listed companies? How might they feel about potentially higher volatility in their stocks in after-hours? Galinov says most international companies would welcome expanded trading. \"U.S. markets are the most liquid markets in the world, so if I am an international company I would be much more likely to list on the NYSE if it had trading around the clock,\" he told me. \"Trading around the clock is much more convenient if I am an international company.\" Galinov now runs the 24X National Exchange, which has an application before the SEC to trade overnight as a fully licensed exchange. 24X recently amended its application to trade from 23 hours a day seven days a week, to 23 hours a day five days a week. Galinov said the SEC is due to rule on their application for an exchange by November 29th.\n",

Better Markets recently filed a brief in opposition to the application of the 24X National Exchange. \"Retail investors who traded during an overnight session would be trading in a market where prices are bound to be more volatile and less favorable than during normal trading hours,\" Benjamin L. Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, said in a letter accompanying the brief. \"All around-the-clock trading on an exchange would do would be to provide another avenue for sophisticated market participants such as high-frequency traders to take advantage of retail investors.\" Jay Woods, a former designated market maker on the floor of the NYSE and currently with Freedom Capital Markets, also expressed concerns that retail traders would be trading in thin markets. \"Prop traders [proprietary traders] are salivating over this because you are going to have the chance to trade against retail traders in very thin volume,\" Woods told CNBC. Still, Woods admitted that, \"This is the direction trading is going. There is some demand, but is it healthy for the market? Is it healthy for listed companies? Is it good for retail investors to be trading when liquidity is thin? There are reasons we take breaks from trading.\"\n",

      "Text: Long-term IPO watchers will note a familiar name is returning to public trading today. Ingram Micro began trading Thursday at the NYSE under the symbol INGM, surging as much as 17% from its $22 initial public offering price . This is one of the largest distributors of technology products in the world by revenue ($48 billion), with operations in 57 countries. We're talking about desktop PCs, notebooks, printers, peripherals, smartphones as well as software products. It traded on the NYSE for many years, before it was acquired and taken private in 2016 by Tianjin Tianhai Investment Company, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, for $38.90 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $6 billion. It was then acquired by preivate equity firm Platinum Equity in 2021. Imgram sold 18.6 million shares at $22, just above the midpoint of the $20-$23 price range. That's a capital raise of $409 million. At a total market valuation of $5.1 billion, the company sold about 8% of the total equity, a fairly small float (most tech companies float 10%-15%). Still no signs of IPO life, despite record highs for stocks Unfortunately, Ingram is not going to change the IPO dynamic. This is the third consecutive year where the amount raised in IPOs fell below historic averages. So far, 126 IPOs have raised $28.1 billion in 2024. Pre-covid, a normal year would see roughly $50 billion raised. IPOs: Total raised 2024 YTD: $28.1 billion 2023: $19.4 billion 2022: $7.7 billion 2021: $142 billion (record) 2020: $78 billion 2019: $46 billion 2018: $47 billion Source: Renaissance Capital Recent IPOs have done well With the major indexes at new highs, you can't blame the stock market for the lack of big IPOs. Large IPOs (over $200 million) have been few and far between the past few months, but those that have come public, like early childhood education provider KinderCare Learnings , aerospace engine maintenance provider StandardAero and diversified retail REIT FrontView are all trading above their initial offering prices. Recent large IPOs (amount raised, and gain from IPO price) KinderCare $576 m. +20.7% StandardAero $1.4 b. +31% FrontView REIT $251 m. + 3.3% Source: Renaissance Capital Still a valuation problem At least for technology IPOs, the problem remains valuations. In 2021, private capital was able to raise record funding for tech companies, which became benchmarks for private valuations. Unfortunately, there were clear indications the public markets were not willing to pay those high valuations. \"Public investors are not willing to pay 2021 valuations,\" Matt Kennedy from Renaissance Capital told me. \"The VC (venture capital) people are still happy to keep funding the companies.\" \"Many companies are still saying, \"We have enough cash and enough funding, let's wait until 2025.\" \"AI companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and they are going to have to find some way to either get acquired or go public.\" The good news: the pipeline is building There are still candidates out there. HPS Investment Partners, a big private credit manager, was often mentioned as an IPO candidate but there are reports BlackRock and others may be considering an outright purchase. Better known are other IPO candidates, including StubHub and SeatGeek. Both have filed to go public confidentially, meaning they are not yet revealing financial data to the public. Another company, Pony.ai, a developer of autonomous vehicle systems for robotaxis in China, also filed to go public next week. A similar self-driving China startup, WeRide, has also filed to go public and may price late Thursday. Still, don't hold your breath. Any large IPOs will likely wait until after the election, Kennedy tells me. That leaves a narrow window immediately after Thanksgiving and into the first week or two of December for any remaining deals in 2024.\n",

      "Text: Both retail and professional investors have become more bullish in recent weeks. Allocations to stocks are rising; allocations to bonds are declining. You can't blame them for getting excited. There's good reason for exuberance: The soft landing remains the dominant investing paradigm; The Fed is cutting rates going into a soft landing (very unusual); Corporate America has become the largest buyer of U.S. stocks; Stocks are entering the seasonally strongest period of the year; and Hopes for political gridlock and/or a Trump win are boosting some sectors. Soft landing remains dominant paradigm The October Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey, a monthly survey of global fund managers, was about as optimistic as you could get. Fully 90% expect a \"soft landing,\" or \"no landing\" at all (i.e. the economy remains strong). BofA: fund managers who expect: Soft landing: 76% No landing: 14% Hard landing: 8% Source: BofA Indeed, worries about a U.S. recession was the predominant red flag throughout the summer, but those concerns are fading, replaced by fears surrounding geopolitical conflicts. Biggest tail risk for investors Geopolitical conflict 33% Global inflation accelerates 26% U.S. recession 19% (down from 40%) Source: BofA Fed is cutting rates going into a soft landing The Fed usually cuts rates when the economy begins to significantly weaken. That's not the case here: the Fed is cutting rates going into, at worst, a soft landing, which is very unusual. Alicia Levine, BNY Wealth head of investment strategy, is in the \"no landing\" camp, that is, she continues to believe the economy is growing at an above-trend rate (she noted two quarters in a row of roughly 3% GDP growth) and that this is bullish for equities. \"When the Fed cuts into a soft landing or no landing, which is what we think is happening, if you look back at six previous examples of this, the S & P 500 is up 16% in the 12 months and 44% in the 24 months after the Fed starts the cutting cycle,\" she said on Squawk Box Tuesday. Buybacks are huge Corporate buybacks are a major factor in the rally this year. Goldman Sachs estimates U.S. corporations themselves are the largest buyer of the U.S. equities market in 2024. Through October 4, Goldman estimates $988 billion in announced buybacks were made so far in 2024, up 21% from 2023, likely a record year. While announcements get a lot of attention, it is the execution of the buybacks that actually result in share repurchases. Goldman estimated that 21.1% of all buyback executions occur in November and December, the strongest two-month period of the year for buybacks. Stocks are entering the strongest season of the year The seasonal weakness typically exhibited in September and October has not happened this year. The S & P 500 was up 2.0% in September and is higher by 0.9% so far in October. Historically, the S & P tends to rise beginning in the last week of October and through November and December. In election years, the seasonal November rise tends to be delayed until after the election, Goldman has noted. The election: volatility declines, stocks tend to rise Many believe that part of the credit for the market's strength is due to Trump's recent improvement in the polls and the possibility of a divided Congress. That certainly may be a factor, but the key point is the fact of the election itself: the historical evidence is that volatility tends to decline after an election, and stocks generally tend to do better. Goldman Sachs noted that, since 1928, the median S & P 500 return from October 15 to December 31 has been 5.17%. But the median S & P 500 return from October 15 to December 31 in election years is 7.04%, a significantly better performance. Things to worry about: sentiment With all that, who could blame investors for getting excited? Still, there's excited, and there's frothy, and we are starting to enter frothy territory. The American Association of Individual Investors sentiment survey shows bullishness near the highest levels all year. AAII Bullish/Bearish survey (week ending 10/9) Bullish 49.0% Neutral 30.4% Bearish 20.6% Source: AAII Bullish sentiment at 49% is very high: the historic average is 37.5%. Same with professional investors. The October BofA Global Fund Manager Survey saw the biggest jump in investor optimism since June of 2020. BofA noted that fund managers were rotating into cyclical sectors (industrials, consumer discretionary, and energy) and cutting exposure to defensive sectors (consumer staples and utilities, though exposure to utilities is still high). Those professional investors also were holding very low cash levels, going from 4.2% (low) to 3.9% (very low), or the lowest since February 2021. BofA considers levels below 4% to be a \"sell signal.\" Other risks: momentum and election The risks: several sectors, such as industrials and financials, along with roughly 15% of the S & P 500 are now overbought (showing Relative Strength Indicator readings above 70). What that means: when stocks and sectors are above those levels it is historically difficult for them to keep advancing in the immediate future. A bigger risk may be the election itself. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) remains at 20, slightly elevated compared to where it has traded most of this year (roughly 12-17), but inline with its historic average of 20. The market seems to be assuming a clear winner will be forthcoming in the election and stocks will rise immediately after, but that outcome is far from certain. If the election is gridlocked after Nov. 5, with no clear outcome, that would increase uncertainty and may delay any rally.\n",

      "Text: Frustrated small cap investors are turning to companies with profits as the bull market in big cap stocks starts its third year. The S & P 500 bottomed two years ago in October 2022 and since then has risen 63%, last week reaching an historic high. Not so with the small-cap Russell 2000 : it didn't bottom until October 2023, and is only 35% off the low, still 9% shy of its historic high in November 2021. Including 2024, the S & P 500 has now outperformed the Russell 2000 in 12 of the past 15 years. .SPX .RUT 5Y mountain S & P 500 vs Russell 2000 in past five years. In exasperation, small cap enthusiasts have turned to ETFs that exclude unprofitable companies altogether, and those funds have been attracting inflows. Small cap investors wait. And wait some more. The academic research has long supported the notion that over long periods of time small caps outperform large caps, and value stocks outperform growth issues. But it certainly hasn't worked out that way in a very long time. The problem is, how long is long? Including 2024, the S & P 500 has outperformed the small-cap Russell 2000 in 12 of the past 15 years. Going back 15 years, the S & P 500 ETF (SPY) is up 440% while the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) is ahead 260%. Many blame the composition of the Russell 2000, which is heavily weighted toward biotechs, most of which are unprofitable, and small-cap banks, which aren't exactly knocking the cover off the ball. Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) (largest holdings by sector) Financials 24.2% Health Technology 14.0% Technology Services 9.6% Producer Manufacturing 7.1% Electronic Technology 7.0% Given this frustrating underperformance, it's little surprise investors who continue to believe diversification is an important component of any portfolio and are unwilling to completely give up on small caps are looking at alternatives to simply investing in small caps based on market capitalization. A profitability tilt Judging by the recent flow of funds, many seem to have found some solace by including an additional factor: a profitability tilt. This makes some sense, since about 40% of the Russell 2000 companies are unprofitabile. If stocks are indeed a call on a future stream of cash flow, then including a profitability tilt may indeed make sense. The SPDR S & P Small Cap 600 ETF (SPSM) does exactly that: it screens for profitability (positive GAAP earnings for the past 12 months and in the most recent quarter) and liquidity. The intended effect is to weed out less stable companies. State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), which runs the ETF, said in July that SPSM has outperformed the Russell 2000 (which does not have a profitability overlay) by 2.2% on an annualized basis in each of the past three years. Investors seem to have taken note. Shares outstanding in the ETF have more than doubled since the start of 2023, indicating strong investor demand. Flows into the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) have been down slightly in that same time period. A similar fund that also tracks the S & P SmallCap 600 Index is the iShares Core S & P Small-Cap ETF (IJR). Other small cap funds with a profitability tilt have also seen strong inflows recently, including the Dimensional U.S. Small Cap ETF (DFAS) and the Avantis Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV). Note: Rob Harvey, Vice President of Dimensional Funds, and Ben Slavin, Global Head of ETFs for BNY Mellon, will dicuss small cap investing on the ETF portion of Halftime Report Monday at 12:35 PM ET, and at 1:15 PM ET on ETFEdge.cnbc.com.\n",

      "Text: Despite the S & P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting recent record highs, the initial public offering market remains stuck in neutral. However, two large deals are likely coming to market soon. First, chip manufacturer Cerebras Systems is expected to announce its IPO imminently. The company specializes in manufacturing semiconductors that are optimized for artificial intelligence. It will likely seek to raise $750 million to $1 billion , making it one of the larger IPOs of the year. Second, aircraft maintenance services provider StandardAero upsized its IPO offering on Friday, which is expected to start trading at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 2. This company services all the original equipment manufacturers, including GE Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, Honeywell and Safran. The company is seeking to sell 60 million shares at a price range of $20 to $23 per share. StandardAero previously filed to offer 46.5 million shares at the same $20 to $23 per share range. StandardAero will be a large IPO, likely raising about $1.3 billion at the midpoint. This would make it the fourth largest IPO of the year, behind temperature-controlled warehouse real estate investment trust Lineage ( $4.4 billion ), cruise line Viking ( $1.5 billion ) and athletic company Amer Sports ( $1.37 bilion ) For reference, the majority of IPOs in the U.S. raise $100 million to $500 million. There have been more than 100 IPOs this year, and only four have raised $1 billion or more. The StandardAero deal is backed by investment firm Carlyle. Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC is also a major backer and will also be selling shares. IPOs stuck in neutral IPOs in 2024 are running above last year's figures, but they are still way below normal levels. So far this year, 104 IPOs have raised $24.7 billion. A normal year would see roughly $50 billion in IPO proceeds. The IPO raise has been sub-par for three years running.

      "Text: Today is triple witching expiration , the quarterly expiration of single stock and index options, and index futures. Each of the four days is traditionally one of the most actively traded sessions of the year. It's occurring at an unusual moment: The S & P 500 is at a historic high. That, Chris Murphy at Susquehanna says, makes bulls happy and bears unhappy. \"Given we have rallied back to all-time highs 1) most puts are deep out of the money and 2) calls are in the money … I think the main way expiration would have an impact would be if we start selling off and market makers who are long hedged calls … need to start selling.\" Week after triple witch: poor Unfortunately, the week after the September triple witch is historically among the weakest of the year. \"The week after September quarterly options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 34 years,\" Jeff Hirsch from the Stock Trader's Almanac told clients last week, noting that the week after has been down 27 of the past 34 years. Fourth week of September: poor (avg. losses since 1990) Dow Industrials - 1.09% S & P 500 - 1.06% Nasdaq - 1.06% Source: Stock Trader's Almanac \"End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter,\" Hirsch said. S & P 500 rebalancing today The S & P 500 will see three new entrants at the close today, each of which will begin trading as part of the S & P on Monday: Dell Technologies , Erie Indemnity and Palantir Technologies . They will replace Etsy , Bio Rad Laboratories and American Airlines Group . As is typical, the \" S & P inclusion effect \" is very evident. This is the phenomenon where the inclusion of a stock in the S & P 500 from the day the inclusion is announced to the day it actually goes in the index usually results in a move up that outperforms the market. This is attributed to demand created by index funds that track the S & P 500. Since the announcement at the close on Sept. 6, Dell is up 17% and Palantir is ahead 20%. Finally, while the S & P 500 is at a new high, the Russell 2000 small-cap index is not far behind. It is only 2% from a 52-week high (the historic high was 2021), and a breakout here would get the bulls even more excited because it adds to the \"broadening out\" story.\n",

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will vote Wednesday to change the minimum pricing increment for many large-cap stocks, likely to allow for pricing increments of a half-cent. The agency rolled out this proposed rule in late 2022. The measure would likely affect the pricing of most of the largest stocks, including most in the S&P 500.

That's an eighth of a dollar higher. That turned out to be a very lucrative business. This all began to change in the 1990s. In 1997, the minimum tick size went from an eighth of a dollar to a sixteenth, or 6.25 cents. This dropped to a penny in 2001. These reductions in tick size had a profound effect on the brokerage business. It made stock trading far less profitable, but it provided big savings to buyers and sellers of stocks.

What they want, apparently, is an intense desire to network with other RIAs and investment professionals and find ways to grow their business. They also seem very particular about the kind of content they want to hear: anything about AI and how to use it, alternative investments, a bit of crypto, and a bit on the markets and the economy. Alongside serious discussions and networking they are also very comfortable with parallel classes on wine consumption, craft beer instructions, yoga, nature walks, and even rock bands (Third Eye Blind!) playing in the evening. Around this mass of RIAs is a small army of sell-side professionals eager to sell them ETFs, mutual funds, financial and management advice, and anything else they need to grow their business. Many of these sell-side pros can be seen in panels that are sprinkled throughout the conference. Reimagining the financial conference Future Proof is the brainchild of Barry Ritholtz, co-founder, chairman, and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, and CEO Josh Brown. This is the third year for the conference, but Ritholtz and company have been doing conferences for 15 years. Ritholtz describes it as an ongoing project to reinvent the financial conference concept, which he says is \"moribund.\" \"We wanted something where people got out of the conference room, get out of the hotel and enjoyed the beach, enjoy the outdoors. Just because we're in finance doesn't mean we have to be staid and boring and running in the bowels of a giant conference, right?\" he said. The ETF and financial services industry is here in force, with representatives from JPMorgan Chase, Capital Group, State Street Global Advisors, Dimensional Funds, Van Eck and dozens of others trying hard to connect with younger independent investment professionals who don't go to traditional conferences. Much of this is being accomplished through a \"speed dating\" service that matches RIAs with sell-side providers for short, 15-minute one-on-ones. Fellow conference organizer Matt Middleton tells me that last year 16,000 meetings were arranged; this year he expects to double that, to 32,000. It's about networking When I asked a group of attendees at the opening panels Sunday afternoon what they were at the conference for, one answer came up most often: to meet with other RIAs and investment professionals. \"I'm here to network,\" Adarsh Shyamsundar from Polaris Capital Management told me. He became an RIA in 2022 after years in the tech business. \"This is about hearing what other advisors are saying, especially the small mom and pop shops around the country,\" Brett Rodgriguez from Graystone Consulting told me. \"We're hear to get something we can't get on a Zoom call--real one-on-one interaction with other people in our business.\" Delon Mansour, an RIA from San Diego, said it's about having a message for his clients. \"I want my clients to see that I am staying active and learning new strategies for their portfolios,\" he told me. Mansour also reflected another motivation for coming: He said he was on a hunt for more products he can use to better manage his business. Hot topics: AI, Alternative Investments, crypto, markets There's plenty of content here, and when asked what they most wanted to hear about, AI came in at top of the list. \"I want to know how people here are using AI,\" Shyamsundar said. \"How should I be using it, and how can I help my clients use AI better?\" \"If I'm using AI, how do I use it, how do I harness it?,\" Harris Nydick at CFS Investment Advisory told me. \"I want to use it effectively, I want to use it compliantly, and I want to know how to safely store the data.\" For Graystone Consulting's Brett Rodgriguez, it's about alternative investments. \"There is a lot of interest from my clients on investing in private equity,\" he told me. He'll hear plenty on that topic. There's a panel on private equity led by Akash Shah (BNY), Shannon Saccocia (NB Private Wealth), Raj Dhanda (Ares Management), and John Christmas (HPS Investment Partners). Also high on the list is crypto. Many RIAs said they were unsure on how to advise their clients. They'll get some advice from a panel with Mike Novogratz (Galaxy Digital) and Anna Paglia (State Street Global Advisors) on the state of crypto. Also often mentioned was the state of the markets . A trio of chief investment officers will offer their view on the direction of the markets for the remainder of the year, including Bryan Whalen (TCW), Saira Malik (Nuveen), and Lauren Goodwin (New York Life Investments). Ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, my colleague Scott Wapner will be interviewing DoubleLine Capital's Jeff Gundlach on the main stage and will later interview him for CNBC's \" Halftime Report .\" ETF luminaries like Jan van Eck and Matt Hougan (Bitwise Asset Management) will discuss the current state of ETFs, including coming competition from tokenization. Then there's the entertainment There are several dozen social events, many of which are invitation only, topped off with DJ Mick and the rock band Third Eye Blind on Tuesday night, sometime in the wee hours. There's also plenty of amusing asides for the attendees. Panels on cybersecurity and estate planning are interspersed with classes on craft beer making and \"Fish Taco Frenzy: Coastal Cooking Class.\" If that sounds a bit odd, it's not to any of the attendees. \"It's all about team-building,\" one RIA from Michigan told me at one of the social events at last year's Future Proof. He had brought all seven members of his team, and was making the rounds talking to other RIAs about, what else? How to grow their businesses. Much of the actual work was being done at the social events and the \"speed dating\" events where RIAs were seeking help on how to run their businesses. Put it all together, and there's enough content and social events to take up about 15 hours of the day for the next few days. I tell you, it's exhausting, being part of the financial intelligentsia. Bob Pisani be doing ETF Edge on Monday from the conference, talking to conference organizer Barry Ritholtz and Jon Maier, chief ETF strategist for JP Morgan, on \"Halftime Report\" on Monday at 12:35 p.m. ET. ETF Edge will livestream at 1 p.m. ET, when Pisani be talking to Jan Van Eck, Marlena Lee from Dimensional Fund Advisors and Jon Maier. That's on ETFEdge.cnbc.com .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Why are September and October historically weak for stocks? For answers, I turned to Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of the book, Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answers have been edited for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is it with September and October being weak months for stocks? Has this always been the case?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. The most intense panics on Wall Street have tended to occur during the late summer and early autumn months. This can be traced all the way back to the 1800s. A few notable examples of exceptional panics include Black Friday of 1869, the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1907.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why September and October?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a byproduct of an old weakness in the U.S. financial system. Prior to the reintroduction of a central banking system with the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the U.S. was limited in its ability to adjust the money supply in response to market conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inelasticity of the U.S. currency made the late summer and early autumn months an especially precarious time, due to the agricultural financing cycle. In the 1800s, the U.S. economy still relied heavily on agricultural production. For the first eight months of the year, American farmers had a limited need for capital, so excess funds held on deposit in state banks were shipped to New York banks or trust companies to earn a higher rate of return.\n",
      "\n",
      "When harvest time arrived in August, state banks began withdrawing their capital from New York, as farmers drew on their accounts to fund transactions required to ship crops to market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agricultural financing cycle created chronic shortages of cash in New York City during the autumn months. If these shortages happened to coincide with a financial shock, there was little flexibility in the system to prevent a panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "How did the government respond to these panics?\n",
      "\n",
      "The limited ability of the government to react was the primary impetus for the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The Act granted the Fed the power to serve as a lender of last resort during financial crises. Prior to the Act, leading financiers (most notably J.P. Morgan) were forced to assemble ad hoc solutions that relied primarily on private capital. After the U.S. barely avoided a catastrophic collapse of the financial system during the Panic of 1907, there was just enough political support for the return of the third and final iteration of a central banking system in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did the creation of the Federal Reserve provide more stability to markets?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and if one compares the frequency, intensity and misery of financial panics during the 1800s, this is plainly evident. In fairness, the Fed made a few mistakes along the way, with the most notable being its failure to stop the contagion of bank failures in the 1930s. But, by and large, the U.S. financial system has been much more stable since the Federal Reserve became operational in late 1914.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the U.S. economy is not primarily agricultural anymore. Why are September and October still weak months?\n",
      "\n",
      "People tend to fear things that have happened before even if they don't remember the origin of the fear. It may be that the fall panics have repeated so many times that they have become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, people expect them, and because they expect them, they behave in ways (i.e., reducing risk in late summer and early fall) that make them more likely. I know this sounds like a stretch, but it does seem like it may actually be real.\n",

      "Text: Pity the poor active trader. September is living up to its reputation as a difficult month. \" Squirrelly \" is how one trader described the market Tuesday. In other words, a tough, choppy market for investors. The markets opened positive, with a nice lift from Oracle , which is keeping the expanding artificial intelligence story going. The company's positive comments on AI helped lift the hyperscalers — Amazon , Microsoft and Alphabet — as well. Nvidia rose as much 2.8% early, only to fall as much as 1.4% later. But that was about it. None of the other semiconductors got a lift from Oracle. Everything else in the group is down, including STMicro, off 4.6% at midday, and Taiwan Semiconductor, lower by 2%. Elsewhere, banks, a former leadership group, have been trending down for the past week, and at midmorning, we got word of third-quarter guidance from JPMorgan Chase at a Barclays conference, where it said net interest income expectations for 2025 were \"too high.\" Stock in the country's largest bank immediately sold off, and was recently down 7%. That alone is chopping about 100 points off the Dow Industrials. But Goldman Sachs , down about 5%, is also knocking about 160 points off the Dow. These were two major leadership stocks in the S & P 500. Both were at historic highs going into September — not anymore. Even regional banks such as Regions Financial , which opened up, reversed course and are now lower. The issues facing the market are well known: weak seasonals through October, concerns about a slowing jobs market and valuations that are still on the high side. Put this all together, and it reinforces the view that there is no reason to stick your neck out.\n",

      "Title: Bears are eager to front-run a recession that has not materialized\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Let's front-run the recession. That seems to be the attitude of some investors at the start of September. Never mind the economic data does not support such doom and gloom. It's certainly not in the August nonfarm payrolls , which came in at 142,000, slightly below expectations of 162,000 but better than Citi's much lower estimate of 125,000 released Tuesday. There were downward revisions in June and July. The unemployment rate came in at 4.2%, in line with expectations. Bottom line: This data continues to support the soft landing. The soft-landing scenario holds that the economy is indeed slowing down, but not going into a tailspin. Some investors — bulls have taken to calling them \"recessionistas\" — seem hell-bent on finding something, anything, that indicates something far more sinister is happening. The recessionistas have been making such predictions every September and October for the past two years. They have been wrong — very wrong. Someday they will be right, but it is not at all clear that this is their moment. Unfortunately, the \"recessionistas\" are not the only problem for markets. Let's front-run the September-October weakness Another chunk of investors is equally pessimistic, but for a different reason. They are agnostic on a recession but their attitude is, \"Let's front-run the typical September-October slowdown,\" and at least on that front they have history on their side, especially the past four years. S & P 500 in September: It's been ugly recently (rounded) 2023: down 5% 2022: down 9% 2021: down 5% 2020: down 4% Traders have been passing around factoids for several weeks, noting that: 1) September is not only the weakest month of the year, but the second half of September is the worst two-week trading period of the year for the S & P 500, according to Goldman Sachs. 2) Corporate buybacks, which have been exceptionally strong this year — likely a record for the S & P 500 — will likely slow soon because corporations will be entering blackout periods for several weeks heading into earnings. Seeing this, you might think the whole world has descended into madness and despair, but you would be wrong. The S & P 500 is less than 3% from its historic high. Most sentiment indicators still indicate fairly high levels of bullishness. And look at the volumes: Bulls have been trying to buy the dip all week but the firepower is not there. Volumes have been light. Aside from Tuesday , this has been largely a buyer's strike, not a seller frenzy. Because valuations are still high, the 'pain trade' is down The biggest problem is the market is still expensive, and the price drops this week have not put a big dent in overall valuations. The pain trade is the trade that would cause the greatest discomfort to the most traders. Since valuations are high — still 20x forward earnings for the S & P 500 — and most traders remain on the bullish side, even as prices have been lower this week, the pain trade is for the markets to decline further. Two pieces of good news for bulls: 1) The market has already been softened up a bit by the belief that the job market is slowing . Citi did that for everyone with their Tuesday call that August nonfarm payrolls would come in at 125,000, below the 162,000 consensus. 2) For some key tech stocks, valuations have become far more reasonable. Take Nvidia , which is now 24% from its June high. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia shares year to date I have emphasized for two weeks that the key to Nvidia is that investors are taking down the multiple on Nvidia, not the earnings. The forward multiple for Nvidia's current fiscal year (February 2024 to February 2025) is now at 37.9 — well below the 48 multiple in June. The forward multiple for Nvidia's next fiscal year (February 2025 to February 2026) is 26.5 — well below the 36 multiple in June. The recessionistas still have the rhetorical upper hand The bottom line is that the information so far is not recessionary, but the \"recessionistas\" seem to have the rhetorical upper hand. Maybe everyone should just relax and enjoy the correction. It's been a while. The last time the S & P 500 had a 10% correction was July 31 to Oct. 27, 2023 (10.3% drop). We came close last month, down 9.7% on an intraday basis. That's what happens with high valuations and a slower economy.\n",

      "Title: The recession crowd has regained the stock market narrative, for now\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Yesterday, commodity weakness in metals was widely attributed to Goldman Sachs, which cut its copper forecast because of projected weakness in China. Then there was concern that the August jobs report, out this Friday, was going to be weaker than expected (stop me if you've heard this before). Citigroup led the downside charge, putting out a call out for 125,000 jobs, far below consensus expectations for a gain of 161,000. This happens all the time now. Bulls cynically call it \"the recessionista crowd,\" those folks who insist there is a serious slowdown coming. You can't blame the bulls for being cynical. Bears have been insisting we are going into a recession for the last two years. Now we are heading into another seasonally weak September-October, accompanied by new cries that a recession is imminent. Someday, the \"recessionistas\" are going to be right. But they've been terribly wrong for two years, and anyone trying to time a recession would have lost a lot of money. Every jobs number moves markets now In the meantime, every data point on jobs is a potentially market moving event. Even the weekly initial jobless claims, out every Thursday and not traditionally a market mover, is watched carefully now. This week, markets are expecting roughly 230,000 in jobless claims. What was it a year ago? About 234,000, almost exactly the same. We know the most likely playbook: if the data comes in better than feared, the Fed will cut 25 basis points and the market will rally. If the jobs data is weak, the market will panic again, but bulls have not abandoned the reasonable assumption that there is indeed a Fed \"put\" that will provide some kind of floor under the market, even if it is 5%-10% below the current level. Tom Lee from Fundstrat, who has been directionally correct all year, is in this camp. He told CNBC yesterday that stocks could see a 7%-10% pullback this fall, but then added that investors should be ready to \"buy that dip.\" Nvidia's multiple is falling, not its earnings Meanwhile, there was much gnashing and wailing around Nvidia 's big 9% drop yesterday. An old friend, veteran trader Joe Zicherman, called me near the close and said this may be the biggest one-day dollar loss ever for a single stock, and he appears to be correct. Nvidia lost $279 billion in market value Tuesday. This looks like a record for a single day dollar loss in one stock. Previous big losses include Meta and Amazon in 2022. Big one-day losses Nvidia $279 billion (9/3/24) Meta: $232 billion (2/3/22) Amazon: $207 billion (4/29/22) These $200 billion dollar down days are getting to be a bit of a habit with Nvidia. CNBC's Robert Hum tells me this is the 5th time Nvidia has lost more than $200 billion in one session. But remember: they are taking down the multiple on Nvida, not the earnings. The forward multiple for Nvidia's current fiscal year (February 2024-February 2025) is now at 38.3, well below the 48 multiple in June. The forward multiple for Nvidia's next fiscal year (February 2025-February 2026) is 28.8, well below the 36 multiple in June. Not so the earnings estimates, which have been rising for all quarters for the foreseeable future, though as we have been noting, at a far more modest pace than last year. Nvidia is down again early Wednesday after reports of a DOJ subpoena around an antitrust probe . While Nvidia is certainly not a value stock, it is much more reasonably priced than it was two months ago.\n",

      "Title: September's poor history is hard to ignore, but market has many things on its side including the Fed\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The bad news is that September is the worst month of the year, but there's plenty of good news to balance out the bad. The bad news: seasonality and the elections September is the worst month of the year for the Dow Industrials, S & P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. \"While momentum usually overrides seasonal concerns, September is hard to ignore – it is the only month down on average,\" Frank Gretz from Wellington Shields said in a Friday note to clients. The last four Septembers have been particularly ugly. September is the only month that has been lower in each of the past 4 years, our Robert Hum tells me. S & P 500 in September: It's been ugly recently (rounded) 2023: down 5% 2022: down 9% 2021: down 5% 2020: down 4% The elections are another wildcard. Many traders believe the outcome will not be known for some time after the November 5th election, adding a layer of risk to what is normally the start of a seasonally strong period. The good news outweighs the bad Seasonality aside, the market is riding a wave of momentum, and with good reason: 1) The market \"broadening\" trend is very real. Two-thirds of the S & P 500 was up in August. The NYSE advance/decline line hit an all-time high. More than 70% of the stocks on the NYSE are above their 200-day moving average. Most importantly, the Equal-Weight S & P 500 (RSP) modestly outperformed the S & P 500 in August and closed Friday at an historic high. Megacap Tech did not have a bad month, but aside from Meta it was not a leadership group: Megacap tech: lackluster August Meta up 9.8% Apple up 3.1% Nvidia up 2.0% Microsoft down 0.3% Alphabet down 4.5% Amazon down 4.6% Other sectors were leaders: Sectors in August Consumer Staples up 5.8% Real Estate up 5.6% Health Care up 5.0% Utilities up 4.4% Technology up 1.1% 2) Earnings remain strong. Earnings topped 13% growth in the second quarter and are expected to remain strong for the rest of the year. 2024 S & P earnings: still strong Q2: up 13.0% Q3est. : up 5.7% Q4 est.: up 13.5% 2025 est.: up 15% Source: LSEG These numbers have not changed appreciably in several months. 3) Sentiment is bullish but not wildly so. The weekly poll of members of the American Association of Individual Investors indicates bullishness at 51.2%, above the long term average of 37.5%, but that's mostly because a chunk of people who were neutral have become more optimistic. Bearish sentiment is not far off from its historic average. Bulls vs. Bears Bullish: 51.2% (avg. 37.5%) Neutral: 21.9% (avg. 31.5%) Bearish: 27.0% (avg. 31.0%) Source: AAII 4) Inflation is waning. The July Core PCE, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, dropped to 2.5%, within reach of the Fed's 2% inflation target. Is the \"Fed put\" back? Another important support for markets: Fed rate cuts are expected. At Jackson Hole, chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that the Fed had shifted its attention from fighting inflation to the job market. According to the CME FedWatch, the vast majority of traders (69.5%) believe the Fed will cut 25 basis points in September, 32% believe a 50 basis point cut is possible. It makes sense most traders don't think the Fed needs to be very aggressive yet: with the job market still relatively strong, most traders don't expect the Fed to get aggressive unless it has to. \"I'm a little concerned if they did something more aggressive, as much as 50 basis points, because I'm concerned that market participants may view that as the Fed seeing something scary in their economic data and are moving aggressively to get in front of that,\" David Smith, chief investment officer at Rockland Trust, said in an interview on CNBC on Friday. Still, most market observers believe that any sign of significant job deterioration will likely be met with more rate cuts from the Fed. This belief in a Fed \"put\" is helping support the bull position that any sell-off around job deterioration will be short lived as the Fed is helping put a floor under the market.\n",

      "Title: Nvidia may find it hard to impress Wall Street with earnings bar raised so high\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Believe it or not, it's tough being Nvidia . The dominant maker of processors for use in artificial intelligence has soared 720% since ChatGPT was introduced in Nov. 2022. It's seen the biggest gain in the S & P 500 this year too, up 160% heading into its earnings results Wednesday evening. At $3.16 trillion, it is now the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock market, just behind Apple's $3.46 trillion. Earnings and revenues have doubled in the past year. Nvidia has not only grown earnings and revenues, it has consistently surprised Wall Street, beating on the top and bottom lines for six straight quarters. And that's the problem: Wall Street has come to believe that beats and raises are part of the DNA for Jensen Huang's company. \"It's hard to keep raising the bar,\" Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management noted on CNBC Tuesday. Most analysts remain bullish, but agree it's getting tougher to impress Wall Street. \"The outperformance of the stock...indicates a high bar for execution,\" Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a recent note to clients. It's not just that it's getting tougher to beat expectations. Two other warning flags have become evident in the last two quarters. Slowing rate of change in earnings growth There are two important trends to follow in earnings. The first is whether earnings are going up or down. But the second trend is just as important: whether the trend is accelerating or decelerating. If earnings for XYZ stock were rising 5% in 2022, then rising 10% in 2023, and are expected to rise 15% in 2024, that is good because: 1) earnings are going up, and 2) the rate of change of the earnings is increasing. In the case of Nvidia, earnings are continuing to increase, but the rate of change is decelerating. Nvidia earnings (year-over-year % change) Feb. 2025 (est.) + 52% Nov. 2024 (est.) + 77% Aug. 2024 (est.) + 138% May 2024 + 461% Feb. 2024 + 486% Nov. 2023 + 593% Aug. 2023 + 429% Source: LSEG You can see Nvidia's peak change in year-over-year earnings growth occurred toward the end of last year, and has been rapidly declining since. This earnings report will likely be the final time in this stretch that Nvidia will see triple-digit earnings growth. Another issue: even though Nvidia's stock price is up, the earnings multiple (P/E ratio), or how much an investor is willing to pay for a future stream of earnings, has also increased. The forward multiple has increased from 40 times earnings to 47 for this fiscal year (February 2024-February 2025), and from 23 to 33 for the following fiscal year (February 2025-February 2026). For fundamental investors, both of these signs (decelerating earnings growth, higher multiple) are cautionary flags. \"There are some things I've learned in my two decades on Wall Street: when you've got expensive valuations and decelerating growth rates from astronomical valuations, there is not a lot of margin for error,\" Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC at the end of June, while discussing Nvidia's earnings growth. Magnitude of earnings beats getting smaller Another set of numbers that have gotten smaller – the magnitude of Nvidia's beats is getting smaller. This indicates analysts are getting caught off-guard to a lesser extent than they were in prior quarters. It's a sign it's getting tougher to impress Wall Street. Nvidia: earnings surprises are getting smaller (earnings beat) May 2024: 10% Feb. 2024: 11% Nov. 2023 19% Aug. 2023 29% Source: LSEG Nvidia's impact on S & P 500 earnings also slowing Nvidia earnings are still the most important of the season. But the impact has been shrinking – just as the overall Mag 7 impact has been diminishing with second quarter earnings growth broadening out. Last season (Q1), Nvidia was responsible for a little more than one-third of the S & P 500's 8% earnings growth. This quarter though, it's expected to make up just 16% of the index's nearly 13% growth. There are two major issues for Nvidia: will spending on AI continue at its breakneck pace, even if profitability is elusive, and will Nvidia be able to keep rolling out new and innovative products? On the AI spending front, despite concerns about an \"air pocket\" in demand, Nvidia's largest customers continue to keep spending. Microsoft and Meta Platforms , two of Nvidia's largest customers, have indicated spending remains strong. \"Neither one of them have given any indication they are lessening their orders to Nvidia,\" Josh Brown noted, adding that 45% of Microsoft's capital expenditures are going to Nvidia. Analysts agree that spending remains strong. \"With U.S. cloud and social media companies pointing to data center (and particularly AI) investment as the catalyst for increased spending, and reiterating their commitment to investing in AI we see this shift as boding well for NVDA's CQ2 results,\" Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said, raising his fiscal second quarter estimates. As for new product, there have been concerns about delays in Nvdia's Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU), which is supposed to deliver much faster performance than its Hopper predecessor, and was supposed to be released in 2024. CEO Huang had previously said he expected to see \"a lot\" of Blackwell revenue this year. Analysts seem unconcerned about any potential delays in the Blackwell GPUs. \"Our discussions with industry participants suggest that potential delays are likely to be measured in months rather than quarters,\" Stifel said in a note to clients last week. \"We are confident that the Blackwell delay will be resolved, and not prove materially detrimental to NVDA or any one of its multitude of industry partners.\" Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis, in a note to clients, said \"while a negative announcement could have a negative 5%-to-10% near term impact to the stock, NVDA has proven adept at quickly coming up with alternative solutions. Furthermore, should a delay manifest, we believe demand is so strong ... that current generation Hopper solutions would be purchased even if Blackwell was pushed.\" \"The ramp of the H200 [GPU] and forthcoming Blackwell launch likely means AI demand outstrips supply through at least mid-calendar 2025, as Generative AI and investments in large language models are driving robust demand,\" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said in a recent note. Most believe AI 'ramp' in early stages Ultimately whether you are a bull or a bear on Nvidia depends on where you believe we are in the \" AI ramp .\" Most analysts remain believers that we are at the start of a much larger ramp, a position long maintained by tech uber-bull Dan Ives at Wedbush. \"While investors may fret about this massive spending wave and frustrated that top-line growth/margins from these investments could take time to materialize this ultimately speaks to our view this is a 1995 (almost 1996) start of the Internet Moment and not a 1999 Tech Bubble-like moment,\" Ives said. And that is what keeps the true believers buying, despite the warning flags. \"Any earnings disappointment from Nvidia has been an unbelievable opportunity to buy over the long term,\" Brown said.\n",

      "\n",
      "The explosion of online sports betting is taking a toll on personal finances, particularly among those who are financially distressed. That's the conclusion of a recent paper, \"Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting's Impact on Vulnerable Households.\" The authors found that sports betting has exploded since the Supreme Court overturned a federal law prohibiting it in 2018. Since then, 38 states have legalized it and it has become a growth industry, generating more than $120 billion in total bets and $11 billion in revenue in 2023 alone. That has put considerable sums into state coffers, but it has come at a notable personal expense to gamblers and their families. Those who participate tend to invest less and have higher debt levels. \"Our results show that not only does sports betting lead to increased betting activity, but it also leads to higher credit card balances, less available credit, a reduction in net investments, and an increase in lottery play,\" the authors concluded. The authors noted these negative effects were particularly noticeable among \"financially constrained households.\" That term was not defined, but the implication is that this group typically has lower savings, lower cash levels to cover expenses, higher debt levels and lower net worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investing takes a hit\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors used a quarterly panel of 230,171 households in states that have legalized gambling. About 7.7% of the households made online sports bets, with a household average of $1,100 a year. Not surprisingly, people who gamble on sports have less money to invest, particularly in the stock market. The authors found a large decrease in net deposits to traditional brokerage accounts. \"Two to three years after betting becomes legal, there is a noticeable drop in net investment relative to states where betting is not yet legal,\" the report said. The authors estimate that legalization reduces net investments by bettors by nearly 14%, and that every dollar spent on sports betting reduces net investment by $2.13.\n",
      "\n",
      "More debt, overdrawn bank accounts\n",
      "\n",
      "But the implications are much broader. \"The increase in betting and consumption drives an increase in financial instability in terms of decreased credit availability, increased credit card debt, and a higher incidence rate of overdrawing bank accounts,\" the authors said. This is particularly true for financially constrained households. The higher credit card debt indicates that these households are not just shifting funds from one type of entertainment to another (for example, shifting money from betting on lotteries to betting on sports). Instead, they are \"becoming more indebted to fund an addictive losing proposition.\" Again, lower-income households suffer disproportionately. The bottom one-third of households by income had the largest increase in spending on sports gambling relative to income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bettors vs. nonbettors\n",
      "\n",
      "There were notable differences between the characteristics of bettors and nonbettors. Both groups had similar incomes, but bettors displayed riskier behavior. They were more than twice as likely as nonbettors to have ever invested in crypto or ever overdrawn their bank account. They were four times more likely to have played online poker or purchased lottery tickets. These results are consistent with several prior studies. One 2009 study concluded gambling‐related activity is greater among low‐income investors, who tend to excessively bet on state lotteries and also are overweight risky, lottery‐type stocks.\n",

      "Text: It's tempting to ignore the markets in the next two weeks, traditionally among the lightest trading days of the year. But there is still a powerful rally occurring. CNBC's Robert Hum tells me both the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up eight straight sessions — the longest advances since November of last year for the S & P 500 and December for the Nasdaq. The S & P has risen 7% over the past eight trading days. That would be its strongest eight-day win streak since the nearly 12% rally in March 2003. Another positive factor: market breadth (advancing vs. declining stocks) has been on a tear. Lowry, the nation's oldest technical analysis service, noted on Friday that the New York Stock Exchange advance/decline line hit an all-time high on Aug. 15. That is one of the best technical signals you can get. It's hard to argue there is a market top with the advance/decline line at an all-time high. Markets now It's happening again Monday: 2-1 advancing to declining stocks on the NYSE, and the S & P 500 ahead 25 points. Tech is lagging but, elsewhere, defensive stocks are strong, with real estate, health care and consumer staples leading. The tech rally appears to have stalled out. Big-cap tech is mixed today, with particular weakness in semis. There is a fairly wide dispersion this month among big-cap tech, with Meta and Nvidia up, Apple flattish and Alphabet and Amazon both down in mid-single digits. Megacap tech this month Meta + 11.2% Nvidia +6.0% Apple +1.0% Alphabet -3.6% Amazon -5.0% Where are we? On the positive side, the soft landing scenario is still intact: Economic data shows some slowing but job growth IS still strong, the Fed is expected to begin cutting rates in a few weeks and earnings have been remarkably stable, even if some companies are experiencing pricing pressure. Perhaps most importantly, the recent volatility in early August caused a significant unwind of many crowded trades, including parts of the yen carry trade , that may help make markets a little less volatile. Market positives Economic data supportive of growth Fed easing expected Earnings stable Partial unwind of crowded trades On the negative side, other than the week after Christmas, the next two weeks are the lightest volume days of the year, when volume typically drops 20% below average. Also, September to October remain among the worst months of the year. Finally, although earnings growth expectations remain strong at roughly 10% this year and 15% next year, valuations are still very high, leaving little room for error.

      "Text: Inflation relief was palpable this week, with both the producer price index and consumer price index reinforcing that inflation is trending down. The real issue for the market was an emerging \"growth slowdown\" narrative, and fears about how far it would go. Today's retail sales report (up 1.0% month over month, up 0.4% ex-autos, well above expectations of an 0.3% and 0.1% gain, respectively) and strong commentary on the consumer by Walmart reinforces that the consumer may be slowing, but is still resilient. Bottom line: the soft landing is very much alive. Where the markets are now The S & P 500 has executed a complete round trip, from roughly 5,500 just prior to the jobs report, to the 5,186 close on Aug. 5, and now back to roughly 5,500. .SPX 1M mountain S & P 500 Index over the past month. Same with CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) . It's made a complete round trip in the same period. Fear spiked to levels not seen since Covid, and then quickly receded, moving from 15 to 60 to 15. This has all happened while market sentiment has remained mostly neutral. One investor sentiment gauge, the weekly survey of investors for the American Association of Individual Investors, is largely neutral: Bulls vs. Bears (AAII weekly survey, ended Aug. 14) Bullish 42.5% (historic avg. 37.5%) Neutral 28.6% (historic avg. 31.5%) Bearish 28.9% (historic avg. 31.0%) Source: AAII During periods of euphoria, bullish levels go into the low 50s, so a reading in the low 40s is well below euphoria. Let's look at other measures of the market: Inflation: Trending lower Interest rates: Rate cuts expected Growth: Slowing but no recession (Atlanta Fed projects Q3 GDP at 2.9%) Earnings: Holding The fact that earnings growth estimates are holding up is critical. S & P 500 earnings growth of 10% is expected in 2024, and 15% growth is seen for 2025. These estimates are little changed in recent months. True, revenue growth hasn't been as strong, and much of the reason earnings are holding up is cost cutting. That, and the need for more revenue, is a clear issue for 2025. Regardless, inflation is moderating. Growth is slowing, but no recession is apparent Interest rate cuts coming and earnings are still holding up. That is practically the definition of the soft landing. If none of that impresses you, here is Walmart CFO John David Rainey in a CNBC interview: \"In this environment, it's responsible or prudent to be a little bit guarded with the outlook, but we're not projecting a recession.\"\n",

      "Text: The big worry for the market was a growth slowdown, but continued relief on inflation is the market story this week. The July consumer price index report was the last hurdle needed to give the all-clear for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. Prices excluding food and energy rose 0.2% month over month, in line with expectations. Year on year, they gained 3.2% — also in line. The CME FedWatch tool, which measures market expectations for changes in the federal funds rate, shows a 58.5% probability of a 25 basis-point cut in rates in September and a 41.5% chance for a 50 basis-point cut. Investors are betting on lower rates in Treasurys as well. JPMorgan's Treasury client survey showed net long positions among clients at their highest since December, Bloomberg News reported . Stocks are opening up, with semiconductors — which are the tip of the spear for any broad rally — leading. This is the second day in a row that stocks have reacted with relief to an inflation report. Yesterday's July PPI pushed stocks up. That rally was so strong that Home Depot, which gave disappointing guidance for the year in its earnings report and was down in premarket trading, rose on the inflation report and ended the day up 1.2%. Where are we? The S & P 500 is now back to where it was just before the disappointing jobs report on Aug. 2. The S & P technology sector ETF (XLK) is also back to levels before the jobs report. Tech bellwether Nvidia is trading above its close on Aug. 1. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has collapsed to 17 — also where it was just before the jobs report. Despite the growth scare that followed the jobs report, there are no signs of an imminent recession. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model estimates GDP growth of 2.9% for the third quarter. Earnings are remaining steady. Third-quarter estimates for the S & P 500 are slightly lower than when the quarter began (up 13.6% year-over-year vs. up 14.8% on July 1), but that is entirely normal. Estimates tend to decline after the first month of the quarter, as analysts adjust overly-optimistic estimates. Overall estimates for 2024 are little changed (up 10.5% year-over-year) and for 2025 as well (up 14.9%). So, what do we have? We have easing inflation; a modest growth scare that has markets betting on easing; and a modest valuation reset in tech that is quickly reversing. Seems like the softish-landing scenario is still alive, with investors quickly snapping up part of the market that were 5% cheaper a few days ago. We'll see about retail sales, due Thursday. That metric has been trending lower. Investors are convinced there is a slowdown in the consumer, and based on earnings reports, there is good reason to have that concern. That could be a catalyst for another modest sell-off. For the moment, it seems like a hard sell to argue to bail out of stocks. We may not have a big reason to move to new highs, but relief on inflation is the big story.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Let's breakdown all the wild market action from this week and how investors at home should evaluate it. Low macro visibility is causing big problems. True, there is not a lot of confidence in a soft landing, but investors are all over the map on where the economy is going. Because of that, it has turned into a good news/bad news market. Watching the yen Here's the good news: We appear to be decoupling from the Japanese yen carry trade. The currency strengthened dramatically into Monday on fears of higher rates in Japan, but Bank of Japan officials appear to have blinked, affirming they would not be raising rates when the market is this unstable. FXY 5D mountain Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust The exchange-traded fund of the week, the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (FXY) , which tracks the price of the yen, has dropped two days in a row. This indicates the currency is declining. Watching Wall Street's 'fear gauge' And now the bad news: The muddy macro outlook, combined with a weak seasonal period, will likely keep the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) elevated. With Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" still near 30, investors are expecting twice as much daily volatility as when the VIX is at 15, which was only a few weeks ago. .VIX YTD mountain Cboe Volatility Index in 2024 That is literally what the VIX measures: expectations for volatility over the next 30 days. The VIX futures curve remains in backwardation . That is, the price of the cash VIX and front-month VIX futures contracts (August, September and October) are higher than contracts that are further out. That is unusual, and it's a sign that investors expect concerns about the macro environment and seasonality to persist for the next several months. Traditionally, August through October marks the weakest period of the year. Watching the economy The good news: The consensus still seems to be that currently we are not in a recession, which JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon affirmed on our air Wednesday afternoon. The bad news: The economy is slowing — it's just not clear how much. Travel and hotel companies have indicated a modest slowdown is underway. Correction vs. 'flash crash' vs. bear market The good news: So far, this is a garden-variety correction, with the S & P 500 down roughly 10% from its all-time high at Monday's low of the session. There is an old saying: The difference between a correction and a bear market is that a correction is about people worrying about bad things happening. A bear market is where bad things really do happen. \"We have the former, but not the latter,\" Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, told me. Was Monday a 'flash crash'? I bet you haven't heard that phrase in a long time. A \"flash crash\" is a sudden and severe price drop that lasts for a very short period, usually a few hours. Is that what happened on Monday? Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of \"Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future ,\" thinks it might fit the criteria. \"It appears that the sell-off of August 5th qualified as a flash crash, although it was rather modest by historical standards,\" he told me. Whatever you want to call what happened on Monday, a key lesson during these periods of market turbulence is that most investors should do absolutely nothing . \"The same thing [panics over real or imagined recessions] has happened not only before but multiple times before,\" Higgins, a student of financial history, told me. Almost invariably, selling during panics is a mistake for long-term investors. Don't let your emotions get the best of you, Higgins said. His best advice: Act like you're 200 years old and you have seen this all before. \"If you think like a 2-year-old you are going to do dumb things,\" Higgins said. \"A 2-year-old sees everything for the first time. If you think like a 2-year-old, you're going to overreact.\" \"Instead, think like a 200-year-old,\" he said. \"If you're 200 years old, you've seen this many times before. You're better off sticking to a long-term plan.\" Higgins retold a story about an investor during the October 1987 crash , which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 22.6%. \"My family ran funeral homes for about 150 years,\" he told me. During the 1987 flash crash, Higgins said an investor was trying to orchestrate trades on the phone while he was preparing to go to his relative's funeral. \"His uncle [who was a police officer] pinned him against the wall and threatened to punch him out if he didn't hang up the phone and get in the limo to go to church,\" Higgins told me. \"Not only did it spare him alienation from the family, but it also probably saved him a lot of money,\" he said.\n",

      "Title: The yen carry trade unwind: A big complication for global markets\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The Nikkei 225 recovered Tuesday, up 10.2%, following a drop of 12% on Monday. That drop, the worst drop for the Japanese stock market since 1987, was about much more than a slowdown in the U.S. economy and whether global stocks should have their multiples lowered. That might be worth a 2%-4% drop. Those losses were largely about the yen carry trade. In its simplest form, the yen carry trade has investors borrowing cheap yen to invest in higher yielding assets, often currencies. When there is a big differential in interest rates, like 4% in the U.S. versus nearly zero in Japan, the trade can seem like free money. But it can go bad very quickly if interest rates begin to change. A bigger issue is how opaque the whole business is. How big is the yen carry trade? For example, because there is not a central source to track currency trades, we have no idea how big the yen carry trade is. But it is big. The Wall Street Journal noted that Japanese banks' foreign lending reached $1 trillion in March, a 21% rise from 2021. We have no idea where all the money goes. The common explanation is that some invest in currencies, some invest in equities. But we don't know. We also don't know who is using the carry trade. The typical answer is institutional investors or hedge funds. That's certainly true, but we don't have a breakdown. Finally, we have no idea how much leverage is being used. These are lots of unknowns, but I would wager that the Federal Reserve, and the Bank of Japan, were a bit shocked at a 12% drop in the Nikkei. How the yen carry trade works The heart of the problem is that Japanese central bankers have been talking about higher interest rates. The yen is rising, and that is making the yen carry trade less profitable. Here's a simple example. \"XYZ Hedge Fund\" borrows 10 million yen, which up until recently was costing just a little above zero interest. It takes the proceeds and buys the U.S. dollar at 155 yen to the dollar, about where it was trading in July. The fund now has $64,516, where you can earn an interest rate north of 4%. It sounds like money for nothing. Things can go wrong because the fund still has borrowed 10 million yen and has to pay it back. If the value of the Japanese yen starts to strengthen, the fund has to repay that debt with more dollars. Remember that $64,516? If the yen goes from 155 to 145, which is where it traded Monday, it will take $68,965 to repay that 10 million yen (10 million yen divided by 145 = $68,965). All of a sudden, XYZ Hedge Fund has to cough up $4,449 of their own money to cover the debt ($68,965 - $64,516 = $4,449). And this is small potatoes. Some funds may have hundreds of millions of dollars in this trade. Leverage makes this even more complicated Much of this is being done on margin, where the hedge fund is borrowing money from a broker. If the value of the investment drops and the equity falls below the minimum established by the margin agreement, the broker may issue a margin call requiring the hedge fund to deposit more funds, or sell the securities. Deposit more funds means find more yen, or start selling. Given the 12% drop in the Nikkei on Monday, a lot of people were selling. The bottom line The price of financial assets are not just determined by valuation metrics like earnings and multiples. Flows — how much money is flowing into an asset class —is also an important determinant. The yen carry trade has created enormous cross-market flows. It is likely a significant driver of flows into the U.S. dollar and global equities, including the U.S. stock market. It is certainly not unreasonable to believe that a significant unwind of this trade, should it continue, would be an additional headwind to U.S. equities. It's little wonder the always-astute Nicholas Colas at DataTrek noted that, \"Until the yen stabilizes, it is hard to see how global equity market volatility declines.\" One positive sign: the ETF to watch is the Invesco Japanese Yen ETF (FXY), which tracks the price of the Japanese yen, had volume six times normal yesterday. After rocketing up five days in a row, it's down 0.6% on Tuesday on much lower volume.\n",

      "Title: The big issue for stocks: How real is the recession risk?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Recession fears are growing on Wall Street after the release of disappointing U.S. economic data and a global market sell-off that led to the biggest one-day drop in the Japanese Nikkei 225 going back to 1987. But how real is that risk? Much depends on where you guess the economy is going: There is not a necessary relationship between earnings and U.S. GDP growth (many companies have large international operations), but 2% GDP growth is often associated with earnings growth of 6%-10%. It's about earnings growth and the forward multiple S & P 500 earnings are expected to be up roughly 15% next year, well above the average, which usually hovers a few points above or below 10%. S & P 500 earnings estimates: 2024: $243.53 2025: $279.65 (up 14.8%) Source: LSEG That would require not just tech earnings to remain strong, but overall earnings would have to be above average. While there is room for some weakness, that would require a still-strong economy. If you think we are going into a recession, that estimate of 15% earnings growth is clearly wrong. But how wrong? If GDP contracts, earnings growth could go to zero or negative. That's what a recession is: negative GDP growth. During the last recession, in 2020, earnings growth dropped 13% year-over-year, though they recovered quickly in 2021. Another issue is the forward earnings multiple, or P/E ratio, which is a measure of how much investors are paying for $1 of future earnings. Using 2025 earnings estimates, the forward multiple has contracted considerably in the last two months, from a high of 20.8 to roughly 19.1 now. Even with a lower multiple, anything near 20 is reflective of an expanding economy, not a contracting economy, so that would also be wrong in the event of a recession. A typical recessionary multiple can be anywhere from 13-16. What's amazing about multiples is that it can contract even when earnings are rising. S & P 500 earnings were up 5% between 2021 and 2022 and a measly 1% between 2022 and 2023, but the forward multiple collapsed from the low 20s to 16 in the middle of 2022. What happened? Everyone was convinced we were going into another recession as the Fed raised rates to combat inflation. But it didn't happen. No recession. Still, the S & P 500 ended the year down 18%. How to game this out? First, a garden variety correction (down 10%), would bring the S & P 500 to about 5,100, about 200 points below where it is now. Beyond that, tell me roughly where the GDP is going to be, and we can bat around earnings and multiple estimates. Let's sketch out four scenarios. The current scenario, where we are now, has 2025 earnings growth at 15%, with a multiple of 19.1. The S & P 500 is at roughly 5,346 ($243.53 x 15% growth x 19.1 = 5,346). First forward scenario: Let's start with a bullish assessment: GDP remains at roughly 2% and international markets are stable. In that case, even if earnings expectations drop to 10% from 15%, the forward multiple is unlikely to slip into recession territory. So let's assume 10% earnings growth for 2025 and because the economy is still growing, let's keep the multiple at 19. That would get you to 5,089 on the S & P 500 ($243.53x 10% growth x 19 = 5,089). Second scenario: Let's assume 10% earnings growth for 2025 and let's say a lower, more historically normal multiple of 17. That would get you to 4,554 on the S & P 500 ($243.53x 10% growth x 17 = 4,554). 4,554 would be about 15% lower than where we are now and would leave the S & P 500 negative on the year (the S & P closed 2024 at 4,769). Third scenario: Bearish. If GDP went to zero or below, the numbers can get much worse. In that case let's assume earnings go to up 5% instead of 15% and the multiple will go to 15, and you get to 3,835 on the S & P 500 ($243.53 x 5% growth x 15 = 3,835). The only reason I am keep earnings up 5% rather than flat or negative is that even in a recession it is reasonable to assume tech earnings will keep growing. So here is a range of estimates(using 2025 earnings ests.): Current situation: 15% earnings growth, 19.1 P/E = S & P 5,300 Lower growth, same P/E 10% earnings growth, 19 P/E = S & P 5,089 Lower growth, lower P/E: 10% earnings growth 17 P/E = S & P 4,554 Bearish: 5% earnings growth 15 P/E = S & P 3,835 Recession, really? Remember 2022 All of this begs the question, are we over-reacting a bit? There's a big difference between a growth slowdown and a recession. The jobs numbers were 4.3% unemployment and 114,000 jobs added. That is nowhere near recessionary. \"114,000 jobs really is not that bad in the grand scheme of things,\" Cameron Dawson from NewEdge Wealth said on our air Friday. \"It depends on what you think the neutral level of jobs should be. If it's 150,00, 114,000 is not bad. If you think it should be closer to 200,000-300,000 then that 114,000 is pretty bad.\" Keith Lerner at Truist Wealth noted that average job growth in recent years has been around 170,000, not far off from the July print and close to the pre-pendemic level. The fact that there has been such an enormous move in stocks and particularly Treasury yields in the last week is a sign the market has been a bit offsides on the growth story. But it's not a sign of recession. Remember 2022: Everyone was convinced of an imminent recession. Everyone was wrong.\n",

      "\n",
      "Text: With nearly three-fourths of the S & P 500 reporting second-quarter results, the earnings picture for the back half of the year is looking unusually complicated. It's been a 'meh' quarter so far We have the usual beat on bottom-line earnings, but revenue beats are below expectations. About 79% of S & P 500 are beating earnings expectations, and that is about average, according to LSEG. Two observations: First, the average beat is much smaller than it has been recently. We're seeing an average beat of about 4.5%, nearly half the 8% upside from the first quarter. Second, only 47% exceeded revenue forecasts, a lower percentage than normal, which suggests some pricing pressure. Companies not making bold calls on the second half It's a bit frustrating. Most companies are beating on earnings estimates but are declining to hike full-year guidance beyond the beat. Coca-Cola , GE Aerospace , Hasbro , Sherwin-Williams , Deckers Outdoor , AbbVie and Lockheed Martin all raised full-year guidance. However, they did so directly as a result of strong results in the latest quarter. A slew of other companies like AT & T , Verizon , Mattel , IBM and Chipotle simply reaffirmed their previously-announced forecasts for the year. It's a sign that despite a still-strong economy, there are too many variables at play and companies are simply taking a wait-and-see approach. Tech earnings are still growing but decelerating There have been an elevated number of tech misses this season, including Fair Isaac , CDW , Skyworks Solutions , Juniper Networks , Enphase Energy , NXP Semiconductors , Accenture and Oracle . More importantly, for big cap tech, earnings growth is decelerating from the huge gains seen in the past two years. A more cautious consumer has reduced many companies' pricing power For example, Procter & Gamble and Clorox have been hit by a double whammy: Price hikes are slowing and demand has been tepid. It has been a similar story for food companies, which have seen volumes fall amid greater price sensitivity from consumers. All the major food names this season – Hershey , Kraft Heinz , Mondelez , PepsiCo , ConAgra Brands , General Mills and J.M. Smucker – have all seen revenue misses on lower volumes. Meanwhile, fast-food restaurants continue to be under pressure to offer value to their guests. McDonald's had seen poor sales , but traffic improved once it launched its $5 value meal. Shake Shack saw stronger June and July sales trends as it has employed \"strategic promotions.\" Wendy's said value is \"critically important\" and touted its ability to offer value before some of its competitors. Further, while it continues to struggle , Starbucks said \"thoughtful promotions resonated with customers in our quest to offer enhanced value indicating that our action plans are starting to take hold.\" The high-end consumer is still spending, but some softness observed One of us (Bob) just returned from a five-day stay in Atlantic City: The casinos were mostly full, from the gaming tables to the restaurants. But Bank of America ran an interesting headline recently: \"Travel/Leisure Cracks Emerging.\" The firm noted sub-par performance in gaming ( Bally's missed on earnings, while MGM Resorts called out fiscal first quarter softness), parks ( Comcast 's parks missed) and hotels ( Host Hotels cut estimates. Marriott cut, as did timeshare company Marriott Vacations . Wyndham lowered guidance on revenue per available room). Airlines were also highlighted, with Allegiant , Ryanair and Spirit noting soft pricing. Plenty of complaints about a slowing China consumer A weak China economy has been a significant headwind for a number of global companies this season. Procter & Gamble's China sales tumbled 8% from a year ago as consumer spending slowed. PepsiCo also observed a cautious consumer there, and General Mills saw \"a real souring or downturn in consumer sentiment\" in the country. McDonald's and Starbucks saw negative same-store sales in the region. Visa said payment volumes slowed within China, while Marriott revealed that it was the only region that saw negative hotel revenues in the quarter. A highly-promotional environment in Greater China was a major factor in Nike 's cautious outlook for its new fiscal year. Despite more tepid domestic spending, there is evidence the Chinese consumer is instead preserving their spending for when they travel outside the country. Luxury names like Kering and LVMH noted that the Chinese are taking advantage of the weak yen and buying products in Japan. Further, while Macao performance was a disappointment for Las Vegas Sands , the casino operator said Chinese visitors are still flocking to its Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore. What's the risk to earnings in the second half? There are two significant macro risks: First, there's an inflation scare — a series of reports that suggest its higher than expected. Second, there's the possibility of a growth slowdown — that is, a downturn in jobs that is greater than anticipated or a consumer pullback that's greater than what we've already seen. We saw a modest growth slowdown scare with the weak ISM manufacturing index reading, particularly in the sub-par employment component. That caused a drop in bond yields Thursday. Here's the good news: So far, overall third-quarter estimates for the S & P 500 haven't moved much since the start of this earnings season.\n",

      "Title: Fed Chair Powell gives the market exactly what it wanted to hear\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell ended a press conference in which he gave markets exactly what they anticipated he would say. The Fed left rates unchanged, noted that job growth was weaker but still strong and hinted it was slowly winning the war on inflation. Stocks have been positioned for a three-stage process from the Fed: 1) setting the stage for rate cuts at today's meeting, 2) examine data in the next month and perhaps fine-tune the response at the Jackson Hole conference in August, and 3) begin rate cuts in September. The first stage is unfolding as expected. Powell, in his press conference, said \"the labor market has come into better balance, and the unemployment rate remains low. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7% to 2.5%.\" If there was any doubt he was feeling better about inflation, Powell later said, \"we have growing confidence that we are on a sustainable path to two percent,\" the Fed's long-term target for inflation. That's exactly what the markets wanted to hear. Markets are now pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut in September. What's next? The good news is the two or three months leading up to a rate cut are usually good for the markets. Next up: the July jobs report on Friday, and then Jackson Hole in late August. The risk to the market is we may get a series of aberrant inflation reports that would keep rates high and cause Powell to make cautious comments at Jackson Hole. Maybe, but it seems unlikely. We are not hearing about weird outlying signals. We are not hearing about skyrocketing rents, or airfares or hotel rooms. The inflation data seems to be narrowing. It's also possible we may see sudden economic deterioration, but that too seems unlikely, and at any rate that would drive rates even lower. Despite the fact that August is usually a rocky month, and assuming the data is unsurprising, the most-likely path is more of the same, more of the rotation we have seen for the past several weeks. Remember what happened in July That said, this is a very tricky time for the markets, and if you doubt that, look at what has happened over the past three weeks. The consensus as we entered July was that inflation was still a very real danger and that the Fed may keep rates higher. Investors were flocking to high-price tech stocks and ignoring everything else. On July 11, the June CPI report came out, which showed inflation moderating more than expected. Boom. Turned out the consensus was wrong. Inflation wasn't such a clear and continuing danger, and a lot of investors were caught offside. Megacap tech sold off and investors turned to small caps and value stocks instead. Ten-year yields have gone to 4.12% today from 4.28%. That trend continues today. If the consensus can be wrong about something as big as where the Fed is going, it certainly argues for everyone to be a lot more humble about their opinions going into the notoriously difficult month of August.\n",

Since small-cap companies often have more debt and higher borrowing costs, the expectation of lower rates is certainly a factor. But valuation plays a part as well. Large-cap stocks, particularly tech, have grown their valuations much faster. I noted weeks ago that more fundamentally inclined investors were worried about the slower rate of earnings growth for big-cap technology stocks . The Russell 2000 would also benefit any time a rotation out of tech occurs because the weightings are different. While the two sectors that comprise technology in the S & P 500 — technology and communication services — are about 40% of the S & P 500, the Russell 2000 is much more diverse.

      "\n",
      "Text: The stock market is facing several issues: a tech re-rating, a slower economy, a seasonally weak period and an uncertain presidential outcome. Big-cap tech is getting re-rated This is what happens when the market gets top-heavy in technology. Like the pros say, when you get a correction in a concentrated market, you take the stairs up and the elevator down. Prices for megacap tech stocks have run up dramatically in hopes of outsized earnings. The problem — as was demonstrated by the reaction to Alphabet's earnings yesterday — is that investors are coming to understand there is still not a big payoff for the artificial intelligence infrastructure play, that the return on investment, or ROI, on AI is not going to materialize for a long time. Tech overlords do not seem very worried about this. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said he'd rather overspend on capex than misread demand and underspend. Investors may not share the same sentiment. Regardless, investors have been re-rating tech stocks for many weeks now. I noted several weeks ago that investors were concerned that, while earnings for the biggest tech stocks were continuing to rise, they were not going up as fast as they had been. Decelerating earnings growth is a classic warning sign. This did not happen overnight. Technology stocks have been toppy for some time. Many of the major tech indexes and exchange-traded funds are down double digits from recent highs. Technology sector ETFs (% off 52-week highs) Ark Innovation (ARKK): 18% Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU):17% VanEck Semiconductor (SMH): 15% S & P Technology Sector (XLK): 9% Vanguard Mega Cap Growth (MGK): 8% Global X Social Media (SOCL): 9% Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ): 8% Semiconductors, which were the market leaders in the first quarter, have been particularly weak. Semiconductors (% from 52-week high, and when they hit highs) AMD : 36% (March) Micron : 30% (June) Qualcomm : 21% (June) Nvidia : 19% (June) Broadcom : 18% (June) Weak economy also an issue Second, there are concerns about a slowing economy and that the Fed may stay high too long. Former New York Federal Reserve Bank President Bill Dudley's editorial Wednesday was the catalyst for this worrywart crowd. Dudley suddenly announced that, \"The facts have changed, so I've changed my mind\" about the economy and called for the Fed to cut rates next week because the three-month average unemployment rate was rising. Don't forget seasonality Seasonality is also a factor, as volatility tends to increase mid-July to October. Goldman Sachs noted that the historic inflection date, the date when the S & P 500 starts seeing more down days, is July 17, with a peak in September, but not really flipping until the end of October. \"No more neon green days in the upcoming summer future,\" Goldman said in the report. Watch ETF flows — they have been exceptionally strong One of the things that has really helped the markets this year is consistently strong inflows into equity ETFs, particularly plain-vanilla index ETFs such as the S & P 500. Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street, noted $500 billion in inflows into ETFs so far this year, on pace for a record year. ETFs already have about $10 trillion in assets under management. Watch the flows here for signs of weakness. It is very typical for flows to dry up in August as everyone is away for vacation. Does the election matter? Historically, most presidents do not have a big effect on the stock market. However, this election may be different. Curiously, \"S & P500 has been super correlated to Trump Win odds lately,\" Goldman wrote in the same report, noting that the recent change in election probabilities — with Kamala Harris now the likely Democratic nominee — may be causing some \"recalibration\" in portfolios. CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall seems to agree. \"The 'certainty' of the Trump trade appears to be fading,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"In the near term, investors may end up being frozen by indecision until clarity improves on a multitude of issues, such as industry regulation, medical insurance, corporate and individual tax policy, and defense spending, just to name a few.\" It is an interesting observation, and just one more ingredient in this very tricky summer stew.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: This week will mark the biggest week for initial public offerings all year. Unfortunately, it may not be enough to get the IPO market out of its funk. Financial services firm OneStream priced its IPO on Tuesday night at $20, above the price talk of $17 to $19. Its shares opened Wednesday at $26. That's the good news. The bad news: The pricing valued the company at about $4.6 billion, but the last private funding round in 2021 valued the company at $6 billion, so the company is going public at a roughly 25% haircut to its last private funding round. This is now a familiar story. Many companies raised money two to four years ago in private funding rounds at very high valuations. Many of these companies are now trying to go public, and investors are balking at the high valuations and demanding haircuts. Biggest IPO of the year set to price tonight Meanwhile, investors are waiting for a massive deal to price Wednesday night. The stock will begin trading on Thursday under the symbol \"LINE\" on Nasdaq. Lineage, the largest temperature-controlled warehouse real estate investment trust in the world, expects to price 47 million shares at between $70 and $82. The company stores fresh food and other perishables in its warehouses, and hopes to raise $3.6 billion. This would be far and away the largest IPO of the year at more than twice the size of cruise operator Viking Holdings , which went public in May. Another tough year No matter how you slice it, 2024 is turning out to be the third consecutive year of subpar IPO markets. Only $17.8 billion has been raised so far this year, according to Renaissance Capital. The average going back a decade is about $50 billion for the full year. IPOs: Total raised 2024 YTD: $17.8 billion 2023: $19.4 billion 2022: $7.7 billion 2021: $142 billion (record) 2020: $78 billion 2019: $46 billion 2018: $47 billion Source: Renaissance Capital It's a valuation problem The issue is not the markets, which despite the recent downdraft, are just short of record highs. Interest rates have also been more stable. The problem is valuations. \"Public investors are not willing to pay 2021 valuations,\" Matt Kennedy from Renaissance Capital said. \"All of the companies that had funding rounds [in the last few years] are aware of this. The question is, how much demand is there in the public market for these deals? The answer is, there is some demand. Companies that want an up-round are going to be disappointed, but companies willing to take a haircut can get deals done.\" The upshot: It depends. Many companies are looking at the pressure of a lower valuation to go public and are likely saying, \"We have enough cash and enough funding, let's wait until 2025.\" Others may be willing to accept the lower valuations — or may not have the choice because they need the additional cash because private funding is no longer available. On the bright side It has been a depressing trend over the past few years. IPOs see a one-day pop, and then trade down over the next few weeks and months. The poor investors who bought on the first day end up losing money. Maybe getting companies to go public at prices lower than their last private funding round will be good for buyers of IPOs, as maybe more companies will see their stock prices hold up after their debuts.\n",

      "Bitcoin ETF have been a hit. Will ether ETFs be the same?\n",
      "\n",
      "By the standards of ETF launches, spot bitcoin ETFs have been a success: They recently topped $17 billion in net flows year to date since their debut. For a new asset class, that is a big hit. However, at $1.3 trillion in total assets, bitcoin has about three times the value of ether, which has about $414 billion in assets. That may limit the initial appeal of ether ETFs. Bitcoin prices rose going into the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. Ether has been a bit spottier: It is up 50% in 2024, but most of the gain came in the first three months of the year. Still, for Ethereum enthusiasts, the primary value of a spot ether ETF is that it's a perfect vehicle to educate the public about the use cases for Ethereum, which are far greater than anything bitcoin has to offer. Ben Johnson, Morningstar's head of client solutions and an ETF research veteran, noted that while bitcoin is often advertised as digital gold, \"Ethereum is more like picks and shovels.\" \"The case for the former is that it is finite and could be a store of value, the latter is not finite and being used to build some real-world applications,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the Ethereum platform does\n",
      "\n",
      "Many investors have never been impressed with bitcoin, primarily because the use case seems limited: It is purely a digital currency. But the Ethereum platform is different. Bitcoin and Ethereum both utilize blockchain, which is a decentralized, immutable ledger to record transaction histories, but they have very different purposes. Bitcoin uses the blockchain as a digital currency. Ethereum utilizes digital money just like bitcoin, but its blockchain has broader purposes. (Ether is the cryptocurrency used in the Ethereum network, but in practice the terms Ethereum and ether are often used interchangeably.) Ethereum is a platform for building smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that enforce a pre-existing contract or agreement. It can be as simple as \"If I do this, you do that.\" The key is that they execute automatically, are done on the blockchain (the Ethereum network) and produce the same result each time they are executed. They also have a wide variety of applications. The most common use is for decentralized finance, or \"DeFi.\" This is just a fancy term for using financial services on the blockchain. In theory, you could perform almost any banking services: Users can send, lend or borrow money, open a savings account, trade stocks or derivatives or other cryptocurrencies, get insurance. Theoretically, you could also do real estate transactions. Users can perform these functions using software called \"decentralized apps.\" The use case goes beyond financial services. Users can play games. Corporations could use it for tracking supply chains. It could even be used as a clearing platform to settle stock trades. Another application for Ethereum: stablecoins. These are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to another asset, usually the dollar. Because cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether are volatile, many DeFi applications rely on stablecoins for lending, borrowing and trading. The promise is a transaction network that — in theory — could be a much cheaper and faster way to do business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does this open the floodgates for more crypto ETFs?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not clear whether this latest development will open the floodgates for more crypto ETFs — or whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will find a way to stop the potential tidal wave. Any applicant for other crypto ETFs would still need to show that the underlying market was not subject to manipulation, a crucial requirement for approval of these funds. But a lot may depend on the political climate. In the past, for commodities, the SEC has traditionally required a regulated futures market to trade alongside the asset. Right now, that only exists for bitcoin and ether, so it would take time to develop futures markets for other crypto products. \"Under the current regime in Washington, that would not change,\" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise told me. \"But if you get a change of regimes in Washington, that could change.\" Regardless, expect a lot of trading. \"These new ETH ETFs will likely trade a lot,\" Johnson at Morningstar told me. \"I'd guess that if and when options on these ETFs become available, this will all go into overdrive.... These ETFs effectively add a whole new wing to the crypto casino.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: A week ago, investors were scoffing at the idea that small caps and value stocks might have a genuine summer rally. This has been tried before in the last few years, and it has always ended in tears. One week later, and the trend clearly has some legs. Money has been moving mostly out of tech for more than a week and into small-cap and value stocks, which are often industrials, materials and some financials. The S & P 500 Value ETF (IVE) , which holds stocks like Berkshire Hathaway , JP Morgan , Exxon Mobil and Johnson & Johnson , finally hit a new high after lagging the tech-dominated S & P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) for more than a year. \"The BIG question is whether this is truly rotational or just a trade on interest rates (rate cuts = small cap rally is out there as a narrative in multiple venues),\" ETF journalist and financial futurist Dave Nadig told me. \"If it works for more than a few days, I suspect the ['fear of missing out' crowd] will start heaving money into products like the Avantis Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV).\" The rather sudden move into small caps and value has already led to outsized moves in a number of exchange-traded funds. Small-cap and value ETFs in July SPDR Portfolio S & P 600 Small Cap ETF (SPSM) + 9% SPDR Portfolio S & P 400 Mid Cap ETF (SPMD) + 7% SPDR Portfolio S & P 500 Value ETF (SPYV) + 4% With the S & P up 3.8% this month, these are not blowout moves but outperformance from these sectors has been so rare it is enough to attract momentum traders. But these are the most obvious moves. Unsurprisingly, some investors are seeking to capitalize on the moves in novel ways. How to play this rotation in a single ETF The game is how to play the market, ex-mega caps, in a single investment. One example: the Vanguard Extended Market ETF (VXF). This fund holds the entire stock market, minus the S & P 500. Sounds weird, right? But it might be the perfect ETF for this market. It takes the S & P Total Market Index, which is the entire investable equity universe in the United States (we are talking over 3,000 stocks), and takes out the S & P 500. The resulting portfolio consists of everything from mid-caps to micro-caps and, with an expense ratio of just six basis points (0.06%), is among the cheaper ETFs to play such broad exposure. It's up about 8% in the last week, to a two-and-a-half-year high. VXF 1M mountain Vanguard Extended Market ETF over the past month. Other little-noticed corners of the market that make similar but not identical calls include the iShares Russell 2500 ETF (SMMD), which tracks the Russell 2000 plus 500 more stocks that go into the micro-cap space, also up 8% in the last week. Or take the Hilton Small-MidCap Opportunity ETF (SMCO), an actively managed value fund that makes more concentrated bets in the small-cap space (the top 10 stocks are 25% of the fund), up about 6% in the last week. This trend of buying small caps and value is clearly more than a one-day wonder: It's now a one-week wonder. There's an old saying among the flow traders that flows aren't necessarily a signal, meaning you have to be careful extrapolating short-term movements, particularly in ETFs. Still, what we have seen so far is already attracting the momentum people. Next step: Let's see if it lasts through the summer.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you look at the list above, it's clear the rich are getting richer. There's about 300 ETF providers, but the top five represent about 85% of all the ETF assets.\n",

      "Neither Fink at Blackrock nor anyone else in the asset management business can afford to rest on their AUM.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Blackrock recently announced their LifePath Paycheck program, an attempt to muscle into a difficult area: the annuities business. Investors have historically been deeply suspicious of annuities due to low payouts and high commissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "LifePath Paycheck uses Blackrock's existing target date fund framework, which automatically adjusts asset allocation as participants approach retirement (less equities, more bonds). Here's the kicker: starting at age 55, a participant can allocate a portion of their assets to a lifetime-income asset class. Participants can begin redeeming their investment at 59½ and purchase annuities from insurers selected by BlackRock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another area of potential growth is private equity. Blackrock recently purchased Preqin, a leading provider of alternative equity data, for approximately $3.2 billion in cash. What they want is more access to private equity data. With the IPO market still range-bound, there's big money to be made in private equity. There's the potential to create indexes for private equity investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the investment is bigger than just data. The big hope — that somehow an ETF of private equity investments could be created — remains, for the moment, a pipe dream, for the simple reason that buying the underlying private equity assets and managing them in an ETF wrapper is exceedingly difficult. (To create and redeem ETF shares, the market makers would have to be allowed to buy and sell the underlying assets, difficult, if not impossible, to do on a daily basis when you are dealing with private equity.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Might it be possible to create an index and then find a way to synthetically mimic the index without owning any underlying private equity? That is a possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line: It's good to have a business that scales big\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the challenges, remember that this is a scale business. You could take in billions of dollars more, and because it is so technologically advanced, the costs are minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is what keeps a smile on Fink's face.\n",

      "Text: Check out the companies making headlines before the bell: Trump Media & Technology Group — Shares of President-elect Donald Trump's media company fell another 4.6% in premarket trading following a 23% plunge in the previous session.

Upstart — The artificial intelligence-focused lending marketplace surged 20% after third-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations. Upstart lost 6 cents per share in the quarter, excluding items, much narrower than the loss of 15 cents forecast by analysts, according to LSEG. The company saw $162 million in revenue, topping the consensus expectation for $150 million. Upstart also issued a better-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter. Pinterest — Shares plunged roughly 12.6% after the online image-sharing platform posted disappointing fourth-quarter guidance. The company sees revenue between $1.125 billion and $1.145 billion. The midpoint of that guidance, $1.135 billion, was below consensus. Block — Shares retreated 2.7% following the financial technology platform's miss on third-quarter revenue. Block saw $5.98 billion in sales, under the expected $6.24 billion by analysts surveyed by LSEG. However, adjusted earnings per share came in slightly better than the Street anticipated. Airbnb — Shares declined 7.3% on mixed quarterly results. Airbnb topped revenue estimates, but earnings came in 1 cent per share shy of expectations. DraftKings — The sports-betting stock lost 5.3% on the back of weak earnings for the third quarter and its outlook.

Sweetgreen — The salad chain tumbled 16.5% in the wake of an earnings miss for the third quarter.

Toast — The restaurant management platform's stock rallied 14.2% on the back of strong third-quarter results and guidance.

Arista Networks — The computer networking firm pulled back 4.9% despite issuing strong earnings and announcing a 4-for-1 stock split.

      "Gundlach, a noted fixed-income investor whose firm manages over $96 billion, believes the higher government spending would require more borrowing through Treasury issuance, putting upward pressure on bond yields.\n",

      "\"If the House goes to Republicans, there's going to be a lot of debt, there's going to be higher interest rates at the long end, and it'll be interesting to see how the Fed reacts to that,\" Gundlach said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\"\n",

      "Notable investors such as Gundlach have been voicing concerns about the challenging fiscal situation. Fiscal 2024 just ended with the government running a budget deficit in excess of $1.8 trillion, including more than $1.1 trillion dedicated solely to paying financing costs on the $36 trillion U.S. debt.\n",

      "\"Trump says he's going to cut taxes ... he's very pro cyclical stimulus,\" Gundlach said. \"So it looks to me that there will be some pressure on interest rates, and particularly at the long end. I think that this election result is very, very consequential.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Trump administration extends the 2017 tax cuts or introduces new reductions, it could add a significant amount to the nation's debt in the next few years, worsening the already troublesome fiscal picture.\n",

      "\n",
      "Text: watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve approved its second consecutive interest rate cut Thursday, moving at a less aggressive pace than before but continuing its efforts to right-size monetary policy. In a follow-up to September's big half percentage point reduction, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%. The rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but often influences consumer debt instruments such as mortgages, credit cards and auto loans. Markets had widely expected the move, which was telegraphed both at the September meeting and in follow-up remarks from policymakers since then. The vote was unanimous, unlike the previous move that saw the first \"no\" vote from a Fed governor since 2005. This time, Governor Michelle Bowman went along with the decision. Stocks closed positive after the meeting wrapped, with the Nasdaq, whose holdings are tilted towards the tech sector, rallying 1.5% to lead the major averages. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed at record highs. Treasury yields plunged after roaring higher the day before. The post-meeting statement reflected a few tweaks in how the Fed views the economy. Among them was an altered view in how it assesses the effort to bring down inflation while supporting the labor market. \"The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,\" the document said, a change from September when it noted \"greater confidence\" in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recalibrating policy\n",
      "\n",
      "Fed officials have justified the easing mode for policy as they view supporting employment becoming at least as much of a priority as arresting inflation. The statement slightly downgraded the labor market, saying \"conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.\" The committee again said the economy \"has continued to expand at a solid pace.\" Officials have largely framed the change in policy as an attempt to get the rate structure back in line with an economy where inflation is drifting back to the central bank's 2% target while the labor market has shown some indications of softening. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has spoken of \"recalibrating\" policy back to where it no longer needs to be as restrictive as it was when the central bank focused almost solely on taming inflation. \"This further recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move towards a more neutral stance,\" Powell said at his post-meeting news conference. There is uncertainty over how far the Fed will need to go with cuts as the macro economy continues to post solid growth and inflation remains a stifling problem for U.S. households. Gross domestic product grew at a 2.8% pace in the third quarter, less than expected and slightly below the second-quarter level, but still above the historical trend for the U.S. around 1.8%-2%. Preliminary tracking for the fourth quarter is pointing to growth around 2.4%, according to the Atlanta Fed. Generally, the labor market has held up well. However, nonfarm payrolls increased by just by 12,000 in October, though the weakness was attributed in part to storms in the Southeast and labor strikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision comes amid a changing political backdrop. President-elect Donald Trump scored a stunning victory in Tuesday's election. Economists largely expect his policies to pose challenges for inflation, with his stated intentions of punitive tariffs and mass deportations for undocumented immigrants. In his first term, however, inflation held low while economic growth, outside of the initial phase of the Covid pandemic, held strong. Still, Trump was a fierce critic of Powell and his colleagues during his first stint in office, and the chair's term expires in early 2026. Central bankers assiduously steer clear of commenting on political matters, but the Trump dynamic could be an overhang for the course of policy ahead. An acceleration in economic activity under Trump could persuade the Fed to cut rates less, depending on how inflation reacts. Powell said the new administration won't factor directly into monetary policy. \"In the near term, the election will have no effect on our policy decisions,\" Powell said. The November meeting was moved back a day due to the election. Powell also said he would not step down even if the president-elect asked for his resignation. He ended the news conference a bit shorter than usual after being peppered with questions about the incoming administration.\n",

      "Wall Street dealmakers and corporate leaders expect the flood gates to open on merger and acquisition activity after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. And he'll likely have congressional help. Trump defeated Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, and Republicans claimed a majority of the Senate in elections this week. That red wave is expected to spell loosening regulations on deal-making, with plenty of pent-up demand. \"We know kind of where the world is headed in a Trump environment because we've seen it before,\" said Jeffrey Solomon, president of TD Cowen, on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" Wednesday. \"I think the regulatory environment will be much more conducive to economic growth. There will be lighter and targeted regulation.\" Solomon added that the scaled-back regulation will be focused on certain areas \"of particular interest to the Trump administration,\" rather than a broad based reassessment of the entire landscape. In recent years, there has been greater scrutiny of pending deals by the Biden administration's Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, headed by Chair Lina Khan. Some have pointed to that dynamic as a chilling factor on deal flow. High interest rates and soaring company valuations have contributed, too. Khan said in September that \"when you see greater scrutiny of mergers, you can see greater deterrence of illegal mergers.\" Her hard line has drawn harsh criticism, but now, there's optimism around a forthcoming FTC with a lighter hand. \"Assuming interest rates drop and you see corporate tax rates go down, the ingredients are there for a really active M&A market,\" said one top dealmaker, who talked to CNBC on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. On Wednesday, markets rallied on the Republican presidential win, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 1,500 points to a new record high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sector specific\n",
      "\n",
      "Some sectors, including financial and pharmaceutical industries in particular, are likely to get a lift under a second Trump regime, experts said. Pharmaceutical executives are especially optimistic that lighter antitrust enforcement could clear the way for deal-making, said one health-care-focused M&A advisor, who added that antitrust enforcement could have \"hardly gotten worse\" under either administration but now believes things will improve \"meaningfully.\" Khan has taken on scores of biopharma mergers over the last four years, arguing that monopolies will stifle the development of new drugs in certain disease areas and hurt consumer choice. Biotech company Illumina last year said it would divest diagnostic test maker Grail after heated battles with the FTC and European antitrust regulators. Also last year, the FTC blocked Sanofi's proposed acquisition of a drug in development for Pompe disease, a genetic condition, from Maze Therapeutics. Sanofi ultimately terminated that deal. \"Whether or not Lina Khan is bounced day one is a key consideration, but even if fewer changes at the FTC take place, there is no doubt this administration — at least on paper — will be far more amicable when it comes to business combinations,\" Jared Holz, Mizuho health-care equity strategist, said in an email on Wednesday. One top dealmaker expected an M&A uptick broadly, but agreed that pharmaceuticals and the financial sector were particularly poised for a resurgence. That deal-maker also noted that with the Senate flipping, more outspoken antitrust voices like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., could find it more difficult to push for DOJ or FTC investigations. In the financial sector regional banks recognize the need for scale, making them likely candidates for consolidation, said one former industry executive, noting that smaller banks had been getting gobbled up for \"some time.\" That person expects the pace and size of those acquisitions to ramp up under a Trump presidency. Other industries, such as tech, may still face an uphill battle in getting deals done. One M&A advisor, who also spoke to CNBC anonymously, noted that Trump's disdain for Big Tech companies — historically active deal-makers — might keep them on the sidelines. On Wednesday, tech leaders took to social media to congratulate Trump. Apparent GOP opposition to the CHIPS Act means that semiconductor consolidation might be challenging, the advisor noted, while cautioning it is still too early to know what a Trump presidency would mean. CNBC previously reported that Qualcomm recently approached Intel about a potential takeover. \"I think the simplest way to put it is more deals, less regulation with the administration having its thumb on the scale, perhaps with a willingness to pick winners and losers,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investments.\n",

      "BEIJING — Donald Trump's 2024 presidential win has raised the bar for China's fiscal stimulus plans, expected Friday. On the campaign trial, Trump threatened to impose additional tariffs of 60% or more on Chinese goods sold to the U.S. Increased duties of at least 10% under Trump's first term as president did not dent America's position as China's largest trading partner. But new tariffs — potentially on a larger scale — would come at a pivotal time for China. The country is relying more on exports for growth as it battles with a real estate slump and tepid consumer spending. If Trump raises tariffs to 60%, that could reduce China's exports by $200 billion, causing a 1 percentage point drag on GDP, Zhu Baoliang, a former chief economist at China's economic planning agency, said at a Citigroup conference.\n",

      "Since late September, Chinese authorities have ramped up efforts to support slowing economic growth. The standing committee of the National People's Congress — the country's parliament — is expected to approve additional fiscal stimulus at its meeting this week, which wraps up Friday. \"In response to potential 'Trump shocks,' the Chinese government is likely to introduce greater stimulus measures,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \"The overlap of the NPC meeting with the U.S. election outcome suggests the government is prepared to take swift action.\" She expects a stimulus package of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.39 billion), with about 6 trillion yuan going towards local government debt swaps and bank recapitalization. More than 4 trillion yuan will likely go towards local government special bonds for supporting real estate, Su said. She did not specify over what time period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock market divergence\n",
      "\n",
      "Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks fell Wednesday as it became clear that Trump would win the election. U.S. stocks then soared with the three major indexes hitting record highs. In Thursday morning trading, Chinese stocks tried to hold mild gains. That divergence in stock performance indicates China's stimulus \"will be slightly bigger than the baseline scenario,\" said Liqian Ren, who leads WisdomTree's quantitative investment capabilities. She estimates Beijing will add about 2 trillion yuan to 3 trillion yuan a year in support. Ren doesn't expect significantly larger support due to uncertainties around how Trump might act. She pointed out that tariffs hurt both countries, but restrictions on tech and investment have a greater impact on China. Trump, during his first term as president, put Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei on a blacklist that restricted it from using U.S. suppliers. The Biden administration expanded on those moves by limiting U.S. sales of advanced semiconductors to China, and pressuring allies to do the same. Both Democrats and Republicans supported the passage of those newer export controls and efforts to boost semiconductor manufacturing investment in the U.S., Chris Miller, author of \"Chip War,\" pointed out earlier this year. He expected the U.S. to increase such restrictions regardless of who won the election. China has doubled down on bolstering its own tech by encouraging bank loans to high-end manufacturing. But the country had long benefited from U.S. capital as well as the ability to use U.S. software and high-end parts. Republicans gained a majority in the Senate for the next two years, according to NBC News projections, though control of the House of Representatives remains unclear. \"If the Republican Party gains control of Congress, protectionist measures could be accelerated, amplifying impacts on the global economy and presenting significant downside risks,\" Su said. She expects Trump will likely impose such tariffs in the first half of next year, and could speed up the process by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% in response to a serious balance-of-payments deficit.\n",

      "U.S. data shows that the trade deficit with China narrowed to $279.11 billion in 2023, from $346.83 billion in 2016. Su estimated that a 10% tariff increase on Chinese exports to the U.S. could reduce Beijing's real GDP growth by an average of 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points in the next two years, assuming other factors remain constant. China's exports to the U.S. fell by 14% last year to $500.29 billion, according to customs data on Wind Information. That's still up from $385.08 billion in 2016, before Trump was sworn in for his first term. Meanwhile, China's annual imports from the U.S. climbed to $164.16 billion in 2023, up from $134.4 billion in 2016, the Chinese data showed. Other analysts believe that Beijing will remain conservative, and trickle out stimulus over the coming months rather than release a large package on Friday. China's top leaders typically meet in mid-December to discuss economic plans for the year ahead. Then, officials would announce the growth target for the year at an annual parliamentary meeting in March. \"China will likely face much higher tariff from the U.S. next year. I expect policy response from China to also take place next year when higher tariff is imposed,\" Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note Wednesday afternoon. \"I also don't think the government will change the policies they already proposed to the NPC because of US election,\" he said.\n",

      "Two months since UniCredit played its opening move to woo German lender Commerzbank , the lenders flaunted their financial strength as one of Europe's largest banking mergers still hangs in balance. Both banks reported third-quarter results on Wednesday, with UniCredit posting an 8% year-on-year hike in net profit to 2.5 billion euros ($2.25 billion), compared with a Reuters-reported 2.27-billion euro forecast. It raised its full-year net profit guidance to above 9 billion euros, from a previous outlook of 8.5 billion euros. For its part, Commerzbank revealed a 6.2% drop in net profit to 642 million euros in the third quarter amid a broader drop in net interest income and higher risk provisions. The lender nevertheless said it has lifted its 2024 expectations for net interest and net commissions income, and confirmed its full-year forecast of achieving a net result of 2.4 billion euro, compared with 2.2 billion euros in 2023. Speaking to CNBC's Annette Weisbach, Commerzbank CEO Bettina Orlopp said the bank experienced a \"very good quarter,\" while acknowledging a clear impact on business from lower interest rates in Europe. She stressed that Commerzbank was on a path of raising its share value through a blend of capital return and higher profitability and the expediency with which the lender hits its targets. \"We have a very good strategy in place, which is also delivering,\" she said — as markets watch for whether the bank will assume a defense strategy to fend off takeover interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "Commerzbank has so far shied from UniCredit's courtship. When the Italian lender showed its hand by using derivatives to build a potential 21% stake in Commerzbank, the German lender appointed a new CEO and sharpened its financial targets. On Monday, the German bank said it had received regulatory approval to buy back 600 million euros ($653 million) in shares, due to kick off after the Wednesday earnings report and complete by the middle of February. Yet Orlopp told CNBC that Commerzbank was not intrinsically opposed to a merger: \"We have nothing to be against, because there is nothing on the table. That's very important to note. And we also always said we would be very open to discuss, if they had something coming on the table, we will carefully review that with our own standalone strategy and see where we can create more values in the interest of our stakeholders,\" she said. The German government has yet to bless the potential union, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz slamming that \"unfriendly attacks, hostile takeovers are not a good thing for banks,\" in late-September comments carried by Reuters. The largest shareholder of Commerzbank, the Berlin administration retains a 12% stake after rescuing the lender during the 2008 financial crisis and divesting 4.5% of its initial position in early September. But a potential schism at home could waylay Scholz's ruling alliance from closely supervising the transaction, with coalition members due to hold scheduled talks later on Wednesday. \"Let's put it this way: we wouldn't be here if we hadn't been invited to buy that stake. And it all started in a way that we thought was constructive,\" UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel told CNBC's Charlotte Reed on Wednesday. \"As part of the wall-crossing process, the investment bank commissioned by the finance agency contacted various investors, including UniCredit Group, on the morning of September 10. The purpose of this process is to assess the market environment on the day of the transaction,\" a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance said in response to a CNBC request for comment. \"The invitation to this process cannot be understood by a professional investor as an invitation by the German government to acquire shares in Commerzbank,\" the spokesperson added.\n",

      "Text: ARK Invest's Cathie Wood is positioning for a White House administration that embraces transformative technology. The firm's CEO and chief investment officer sees a boom sparked by fewer regulations — no matter who wins the presidential election. \"Both candidates have sounded more and more alike,\" Wood said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Fast Money .\" \"It seems to be a bipartisan issue.\" Wood runs the firm's flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) — which is up almost 22% over the past three months. But it's been a disappointing year so far for the fund. After soaring nearly 68% last year, the ARK Innovation ETF is down about 8% in 2024. It has also fallen significantly since President Joe Biden took office. ARKK suffered a roughly 67% decline in 2022, the same year that the Federal Reserve embarked on its rate-hiking campaign. Tech companies, like those held in ARKK, are especially sensitive to rising rates. \"Many people have associated our portfolio with low interest rates. Certainly, algorithmic trading seemed to do that,\" said Wood. \"I think that's going to change.\" The ETF's top holding right now is Tesla . The stock is virtually flat this year after surging about 102% in 2023. Wood bets that the underperformance is temporary . \"This is not an auto stock. Certainly, not a traditional one. It's a robotic stock. So, autonomous vehicles are robots. They'll be electric, and they're powered by AI,\" she said. \"This is story has just begun.\" Wood is also behind the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) , which is down about 25% so far this year. But she's sticking with the main strategy that AI in health care will usher in a new age. \" CRISPR Therapeutics [and] Beam Therapeutics and other companies have developed cures for disease,\" Wood said. 'We are going to see real results as we move people out of hospitals and into cures.\" CRISPR is up 11% over the past month, while Beam is up 2% in the period. The ARK Genomic Revolution ETF owns both stocks. Disclaimer\n",

      "BEIJING — Deeproute.ai, a Chinese startup developing autonomous driving systems, announced a $100 million funding round Tuesday from an undisclosed automaker, while emphasizing close ties with chipmaker Nvidia . Pitchbook data showed Chinese company Great Wall Motor led the investment. It's been difficult to obtain financing, especially from a non-government source, Maxwell Zhou, CEO of DeepRoute.ai, told reporters Tuesday in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. The startup is also in \"deep cooperation\" with Nvidia, Zhou said, noting \"in-depth discussions\" with the chipmaker's CEO Jensen Huang. Zhou spoke on \"Commercializing mass-produced autonomous driving solutions\" at Nvidia's closely watched GTC AI conference in March.\n",
      "\n",
      "watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "Shenzhen-based Deeproute said it uses Nvidia's Orin chip for its current driver-assist system. The startup added it is part of the first batch of companies in China to obtain Nvidia's newer Thor chip for cars and will release a new system using it next year that can use more visual cues to manage more complex driving scenarios. \"Lots of companies in China are competing on autonomous driving. It is actually a competition over AI,\" Zhou said. In terms of AI computing power, Deeproute said it has its own capacity, and can tap Alibaba 's if needed. The e-commerce and cloud computing company led a $300 million investment round in Deeproute in 2021, giving it a valuation of more than $1 billion just two years after it was founded in 2019, according to the startup. The U.S. in October 2022 imposed sweeping restrictions on China's ability to access the most advanced semiconductors from Nvidia and other American companies. Automotive chips don't currently fall in that category. Nvidia is scheduled to release earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 27 on Nov. 20. For the quarter ended July 28, the chipmaker said its automotive segment saw revenue rise by 37% year-on-year to $345 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eyes on Japan\n",
      "\n",
      "Deeproute currently works with Chinese automakers selling in China. The company expects at least three car models using its driver-assist system will hit the road this year. Already, Deeproute's systems are running in more than 20,000 cars on the road, Zhou said. He expects that number to increase, potentially by ten-fold, next year. The startup, which has an office in California, said it is looking to work with foreign automakers and plans to participate in Japan's auto show next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla competition\n",
      "\n",
      "Deeproute has focused on using artificial intelligence to automatically drive cars, without relying on \"high-definition maps.\" That allows a vehicle to use driver assist tech on roads where those technical parameters haven't been created. It's a trend car tech companies such as Xpeng and Huawei are pursuing — and Tesla 's strategy for developing autonomous driving. Elon Musk's car company has focused on using cameras and artificial intelligence to steer the vehicle, without heavy reliance on HD maps. Those maps, used by autonomous driving companies such as Alphabet's Waymo, give a car a detailed picture of city streets. But they need to be created before a car runs on the road, a process that can drive up costs. Zhou said the company is very eager for Tesla's driver-assist product — called \"Full Self-Driving\" — to enter China. His reasoning is that Tesla's product will encourage more consumers to become more interested in driver-assist features — and boost Deeproute's prominence in the sector. When asked about IPO plans, Zhou said the startup would keep to its own development pace, but it welcomed the latest public offerings of other industry players. Chinese autonomous driving software developer WeRide went public on the Nasdaq last month, while robotaxi operator Pony.ai has filed for a U.S. IPO.\n",

      "Text: The earnings season is winding down, but there are several key companies still on deck to report. Of the nine S & P 500 companies scheduled to post their third-quarter results, Home Depot and Disney are among them. Investors will look to these results for clues on whether the stock market's postelection rally can continue. Thus far more than 450 S & P 500 names have posted their results. Of those, 74% have beaten earnings expectations, per FactSet. Below is a breakdown of what to expect from some of the S & P 500 members slated to report. All times are Eastern. Tuesday Home Depot is set to report earnings in the premarket. A call with management is slated for 9 a.m. Last quarter: HD said it sees sales weakening amid a more cautious customer . This quarter: Analysts polled by LSEG see a small year-over-year earnings decline for the home improvement giant. What CNBC is watching: UBS thinks same-store sales will be weak for Home Depot, citing weak demand. \"Further, we think ongoing pressure on larger projects pushed pros to engage in smaller projects. Still, newness and innovation likely prompted consumers to trade up in certain categories, providing top-line support,\" analyst Michael Lasser wrote Friday. What history shows: Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows Home Depot has beaten earnings expectations for 17 straight quarters. Live Nation Entertainment is set to report earnings before the bell, followed by a call at 9 a.m. Last quarter: LYV reported operating income that beat expectations, while revenue was in line with estimates, per StreetAccount. This quarter: The entertainment conglomerate is expected to report a 10% earnings decline from the year-earlier period, LSEG data shows. What CNBC is watching: Live Nation has been a clear winner in 2024, up 31% in that time, an Morgan Stanley expects that momentum to continue. The bank last week raised its price target to $140 from $120, implying upside of 13.8%. \"LYV remains our preferred exposure to strong consumer demand for live events and concerts. While less stadium activity in 3Q drives '24 slightly lower ... an improved '25 outlook drives up estimates & PT,\" the bank wrote. What history shows: Live Nation shares have risen after the last four earnings releases, per Bespoke. Thursday Walt Disney is set to report earnings in the premarket, with a call scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Last quarter: DIS beat estimates, with the company's combined streaming services turning a profit . This quarter: The media giant is expected to post earnings growth of more than 30% year on year, according to LSEG. What CNBC is watching: Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris thinks the key for investors will be Disney's guidance. \"Our updated FY25 estimates are 2% ahead of consensus on revenue and operating income, with the largest positive variances at Content, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC), and Experiences,\" he said last month. What history shows: Disney has not done well following the last two releases, losing 4.5% and 9.5%, respectively. Applied Materials is set to report earnings after the open. A call with management is set for 4:30 p.m. Last quarter: AMAT company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. This quarter: Analysts expect slight year-over-year earnings and revenue growth year on year, LSEG data shows. What CNBC is watching: Applied Materials has lagged the broader semiconductor sector this year, rising more than 18% while the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has soared 48% in that time. Can this week's report spark a catch-up trade for the stock? What history shows: Applied Materials shares average a gain of 0.8% on earnings days, per Bespoke.\n",

      "Text: Wall Street analysts are looking ahead to President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House, and many stocks could be poised to benefit. CNBC Pro combed through the most recent Wall Street research to find companies analysts really like heading into 2025 based on potential Trump policies. They include General Motors, Ford Motor, Robinhood , Coinbase , GE Aerospace and Goldman Sachs. Ford and General Motors Bank of America said both automakers are best positioned in a Trump presidency. \"We see F and GM as the main beneficiaries from the Trump administration,\" analyst John Murphy wrote. This is because there will be less pressure to shift the auto companies toward electric vehicles, he added. \"On the other end, EV OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] may face slower demand due to less pressure to go electric and lower IRA incentives.\" Murphy said Mexico tariffs are a risk, but he urged investors to remain calm. Shares of Ford are down 10% in 2024, and General Motors is up close to 55% this year. Coinbase and Robinhood Needham analyst John Todaro sees both stocks as beneficiaries of a crypto renaissance under a Trump administration, although the firm currently has a neutral rating on Robinhood. \"We expect the entire crypto sector to benefit from the Trump win, but the largest positive impact on COIN & HOOD,\" he wrote. Todaro said both companies may feel more compelled to usher in additional crypto products under a Trump presidency that may be more amenable to bitcoin uses. \"In addition to Trump winning, the House and Senate (elected & re-elected) majority pro crypto candidates to make the most pro-crypto political landscape in US history,\" he added. Shares of Robinhood are up nearly 140% in 2024, while Coinbase is up more than 55% this year. GE Aerospace The aerospace company has pricing power, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle, who says GE can benefit under a Trump administration. \"In the event that some combination of increased fiscal spending, tax cuts, and tariffs were to drive persistency to the current above-trend rate of inflation, then we think companies in our coverage with the greatest pricing power would continue to stand out as relative winners,\" he wrote, including GE in that mix. Defense spending is also likely to rise under a GOP White House, making GE a standout, the analyst added. The company is a key engine supplier on U.S. military aircraft as well as internationally. \"Additionally, we think GE could be among the largest beneficiaries of this potential trend within our aerospace coverage,\" Deuschle said. The stock is up more than 80% this year with more room to run, he wrote. Ford and GM – Bank of America, buy ratings \"We see F and GM as the main beneficiaries from the Trump administration. The current environmental regime would pressure the core business of legacy OEMs (trucks) to decarbonize by the end of the decade while shifting quickly to an EV portfolio. … On the other end, EV OEMs may face slower demand due to less pressure to go electric and lower IRA incentives.\" Coinbase – Needham, buy rating; Robinhood – Needham, neutral rating \"On the back of this, we expect HOOD in the medium term to launch more crypto products as well as COIN and would expect more favorable outcomes on the SEC cases. In addition to Trump winning, the House and Senate (elected & re-elected) majority pro crypto candidates to make the most pro-crypto political landscape in US history.\" GE Aerospace – Deutsche Bank, buy rating \"In the event that some combination of increased fiscal spending, tax cuts, & tariffs were to drive persistency to the current above-trend rate of inflation, then we think companies in our coverage with the greatest pricing power would continue to stand out as relative winners. … Additionally, we think GE could be among the largest beneficiaries of this [defense spend] potential trend within our aerospace coverage...\" Goldman Sachs – Wells Fargo, overweight rating \"Capital markets momentum and the chance for a super cycle. More free markets imply that investment banking revenues have a chance at exceeding 2021 levels over the next few years. The idea of a capital markets super-cycle seems possible (albeit not a base case), esp. given the level of pent-up demand, dry powder, and likely more certainty in deals getting approved.

      "Title: Piper Sandler says Trump will usher in a wave of mainstream crypto adoption — so buy these stocks\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The new Trump administration will offer a good backdrop for crypto-related stocks, according to Piper Sandler. Cryptocurrency-linked assets surged on Wednesday following Trump's victory. The president-elect has indicated his support for the industry, and more favorable regulations under a new administration could continue to send digital currencies like bitcoin to new all-time heights . On Wednesday, bitcoin rallied above $76,000 for the first time in history. \"Early in the election cycle, President-elect Trump came out in support of crypto and was viewed as the most crypto friendly candidate in the race,\" wrote Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley in a note Thursday. \"Since then we've seen a broader bi-partisan, pro-crypto shift in D.C. with > 200 pro-crypto candidates elected [Tuesday]. Given this shift in sentiment we expect to see comprehensive crypto legislation passed in the coming quarters and believe regulatory clarity will result in further mainstream crypto adoption.\" Against this more favorable backdrop, Moley shared several stocks he currently rates overweight and that offer investors exposure to the crypto industry: The Piper Sandler analyst highlighted Robinhood as \"the most attractive way to play the crypto space\" within his coverage universe. Shares of the financial trading platform have more than doubled this year, surging 130%. Moley estimated that crypto made up around 13% of Robinhood's revenues in the past 12 months. \"Its monetized crypto offering is significantly more robust than traditional retail brokerage peers, with over 15 tokens available to trade,\" the analyst wrote of Robinhood. \"When a comprehensive regulatory framework around crypto is eventually introduced in the U.S., we believe HOOD will likely look to expand its crypto offering by (1) increasing the number of tokens available for trading on its platform and (2) introducing new products like staking (and possibly lending) to a customer base ready to adopt new crypto products.\" Still, Moley's $30 price target on Robinhood is only a fraction above where the stock closed Thursday. Moley was also bullish on shares of CME Group , up 5% this year. While crypto is currently an \"immaterial\" part of CME's business — making up less than 1% of its revenue in the past 12 months — the company is the \"premier venue for commercial & institutional users of crypto derivatives,\" the analyst wrote. \"CME currently offers 9 different crypto contracts across BTC (5) and ETH (4). However, through its partnership with CF Benchmarks it has an additional 28 reference rates that we think it could look to launch new contracts on if regulatory clarity improves,\" the analyst added. Moley's $250 price target implies that CME stock could add another 13% over the next 12 months. Although crypto made up less than 5% of Virtu Financial 's revenue in the past year, Moley said that the platform was \"quietly operating as one of the major traditional finance players in the crypto space.\" \"The market maker is currently an authorized participant on ALL of the publicly traded spot bitcoin & ether ETFs (20+) and we think the future launch of options on these spot crypto ETFs could add another layer to VIRT's crypto revenues,\" the analyst wrote. \"All in all, as crypto's presence in traditional finance evolves, we think VIRT is positioned well to benefit.\" Shares of Virtu Financial have climbed 65% in 2024. Moley's $35 price target is nearly 5% higher than where the stock closed on Thursday. Finally, Moley gave an honorable mention to trading platform Cboe Global Markets . Less than 1% of the Cboe's revenue was derived from crypto assets in the last 12 months. The company \"offers & clears cash-settled bitcoin & ether futures contracts,\" Moley wrote, and \"recently exited its spot digital asset trading platform and consolidated its digital asset derivatives into its existing Global Derivatives & Clearing Business.\" Shares of Cboe have added 12% this year, trailing the broader market, and Moley's $220 price target implies an additional 9% upside.\n",

      "Title: These are the most overbought stocks after Trump's win this week\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Several software companies could be due for a pullback after the stock market's roaring rally this week, fueled by President-elect Donald Trump's election victory as well as robust quarterly earnings reports. Major U.S. indexes are on track for major wins this month, with the S & P 500 up roughly 5% and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average higher by 5.3%, putting both on track for their best gain in a year. The Nasdaq has jumped 6.4% so far in November. Investors are buoyed by the prospect of less government regulation of business, more deal-making and proposed tax cuts under a second Trump administration. But amid these bullish moves and renewed market enthusiasm, shares of some companies that have raced ahead this month could be due for a pullback according to one popular market yardstick. CNBC Pro screened for stocks that are considered technically overbought using their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI, a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the speed and magnitude of a stock price. Companies with a 14-day RSI higher than 70 are generally regarded as overbought, signaling a potential pullback ahead, while a 14-day RSI below 30 suggests a stock is oversold and may be poised for a bounce higher. Shares of video game makers Take-Two Interactive Software and Electronic Arts are two of the stocks that are technically overbought right now, according to the analysis. Take-Two shares added more than 8% this week on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results. The company reported $1.47 billion in revenue in its fiscal second quarter, topping analysts' consensus estimate of $1.43 billion, according to LSEG. Several brokers adjusted their price targets on Take-Two after its earnings results. Morgan Stanley kept an overweight rating while lifting its target by $15 to $200, saying the company \"continued showing strong results, particularly in mobile, as the focus remains on [Grand Theft Auto] the pipeline.\" That suggests 11.6% potential upside. Take-Two's RSI is nearly 84.8, however, suggesting the stock has risen too far, too fast, and may prove vulnerable to a downdraft. Electronic Arts, another software company, has an RSI even higher, at about 85.2. The stock is up 5% this month, after its second-quarter net bookings came in better than expected and set a quarterly record. Analysts were enthused by revenue and strong execution from the company's sports portfolio, especially college football, and its recent Dragon Age: The Veilguard video game launch. The most overbought stock this week was human capital management software company Dayforce, with an RSI of 92.4. The stock was also considered overbought in late October. Shares are up more than 33% over the past month and hit a new 52-week high on Friday. Other stocks that could be due for a pullback are Paycom Software and pharmaceutical companies Incyte and Gilead Sciences . In addition, take a look at the market's most oversold names from our CNBC Pro screener: Packaged food and consumer goods companies General Mills , Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr Pepper are now considered oversold. Consumer staples has been one of the slower-growing sectors this year, and is down 1.7% this quarter. But higher prices and expectations of normalizing pricing, which helped Coke guide its organic revenue growth this year to the high end of a prior forecast, could lead the stocks higher. Other oversold stocks include power generation company AES , as well as radio frequency equipment maker Qorvo and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals — the latter two of which were also oversold the previous week.\n",

      "Title: The 10-year Treasury yield has been rising. Here's where BlackRock’s Rick Rieder sees an opportunity\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Opportunities abound for income-seeking investors, even as the 10-year Treasury has seen a volatile week, according to BlackRock's Rick Rieder. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has been steadily climbing this fall, taking a sharper turn higher as Election Day approached. The rate was at about 4% a month ago, and surged 15 basis points to top 4.4% on Wednesday in the wake of Donald Trump winning a second term in the White House. The 10-year yield has cooled since then. It traded at roughly 4.3% on Friday, one day after the Federal Reserve dialed back interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Bond yields and prices have an inverse relationship, so yields rise when prices fall. Further, bonds that have longer maturities tend to have greater price sensitivity to fluctuations in rates, which is known as duration. Longer-dated issues, such as the 10-year Treasury, have faced considerable volatility and seen their prices slide lately, pushing up yields. But investors don't have to anchor themselves too far out on the yield curve to snap up solid income, said Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, in a phone call with CNBC. \"I think fixed income is interesting,\" he said. \"There is so much yield everywhere.\" Managing duration risk Rieder, who is also a portfolio manager on the iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC) , likes the front end and the belly of the yield curve, aiming for a duration of about three to four years. Issues that are closer to the front of the curve tend to have shorter duration, and thus less price sensitivity to swings in rates. Corners of the market he finds attractive today include high-yield bonds — or those issues with a rating below BBB from Standard & Poor's or below Baa from Moody's Ratings. They also tend to have relatively shorter duration compared with other fixed-income assets. The iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (USHY) , for instance, has a duration of 3.2 years and a 30-day SEC yield of 7.22%. Meanwhile, the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund (VWEHX) has an average duration of 2.9 years, and a 30-day SEC yield of 6.03%. These bonds are riskier than their investment grade counterparts and Treasurys, but they can offer some diversification benefits in a broad fixed-income portfolio. Collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, are another favorite for Rieder. \"I love the CLO market, and it's one of the best opportunities today,\" he said. CLOs are floating rate loans made to businesses, which can themselves be non-investment grade. The loans are made up of tranches with their own risk characteristics. Those that are deemed AAA by ratings agencies are at the front of the line to get paid if a borrower has to be restructured, recapitalized or goes bankrupt. Investors piled into CLO ETFs earlier this year as a play on the higher-rate environment . Though their short-duration nature means that their income could come down as rates fall, portfolio managers who specialize in the sector say CLO ETFs still offer attractive returns compared with other fixed-income classes. \"You can stay higher quality, floating rate oriented, and clip yield,\" Rieder said. The iShares AAA CLO Active ETF (CLOA) has a duration of less than a year and a 30-day SEC yield of 6.24%. The Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) is one of the big players in the CLO ETF space, with a 30-day SEC yield of 6.32% and a duration of less than a year. Rieder also likes fixed income in Europe and securitized assets. He thinks it's prime time for income investors to snap up yield without stretching into lower quality. \"There are epic amounts of cash sitting out here, and if you can get that yield and marry it to an equity portfolio, I think it makes a ton of sense,\" he said.\n",

In fact, Apple's relative performance to the tech sector peaked more than two years ago — in Q3 2022 — and has not improved in any meaningful way. The exact date of Apple's relative performance peak was Sept. 27 2022. Since then, Apple (AAPL) is +49.9% while the SPDR Technology Select Sector ETF (XLK) is +92.7%.

Feldman cited upcoming Fed rate cuts as a catalyst. Home Depot is one company that should benefit from an easing monetary cycle, since lower interest rates could boost increased consumer spending in home improvement going forward. The Fed has embarked on a new rate-cutting cycle as inflation pressures have eased. On Thursday, the Fed lowered rates by a quarter percentage point .

This recovery could last through multiple quarters in 2025, according to Telsey.

      "\n",
      "Text: Former U.S. President Donald Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in this week's election has raised questions about how Asia will be impacted. \"At face value, Trump 2.0 is bad news for Asia, esp[ecially] China,\" analysts at Macquarie Research wrote in a Nov. 7 note, given the president-elect's plans to raise tariffs and cut taxes. \"When passed, the [tariffs] will sweep across Asia, particularly China [and] should spike volatility and compress multiples as uncertainty prevails.\" Even so, the analysts say the region is \"more prepared than in 2016\" and investment opportunities remain, especially given the weaker yen and stimulus in China. Market reaction to the election result has been mixed, with India's Nifty 50 index falling over 1% and Japan's Nikkei 225 slipping 0.25% on Thursday. In China, meanwhile, the blue-chip CSI 300 index closed over 3% higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 2% as economic data and hopes of further stimulus boosted stocks. The market moves in Asia come after a surge in U.S. stocks on Wednesday pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average , S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to new all-time highs. The \"positive reaction to the stock market,\" follows reduced political uncertainties, Tai Hui, APAC chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said. Sectors to watch Looking ahead, Hui believes \"an economic soft landing and steady rate cuts by the Fed[eral Reserve] should be positive for both stocks and bonds, as well as selective alternative assets, such as infrastructure and transportation.\" This will bring about \"structural shifts in global supply chain ... [and] could boost infrastructure spending in ASEAN and South Asia,\" he added. Touching on the impact of potential tariffs on imports — especially from China — into the U.S., the strategist believes the \"direct earnings impact ... is likely to be limited, given [that] more than 85% of MSCI China's primary revenue comes from mainland China.\" \"While slower exports would impact domestic investment and consumption indirectly, Beijing's fiscal and monetary policies could offer some offset. Hence, the possible measures from this week's [National People's Congress] meeting could be material in countering investors' concerns from external factors,\" he added. Stocks to play As investors await the outcomes of the closely-watched meeting by China's top legislature, Macquarie is looking to \"domestic pure plays,\" such as fast-food restaurant chain Yum China . The analysts also like automotive manufacturer XPeng in the electric vehicle space as the nation's \"energy transition and battery supply chain will likely see multiples compress on rising uncertainty.\" Over in Japan, the Australian investment bank is betting on equities expected to benefit from a weaker yen. The currency has fallen versus the dollar following Trump's win, hitting 154.7 per dollar on Wednesday — its weakest level since July 30. On Thursday it recovered some ground to trade around 153.64. Macquarie's top Japan picks include test equipment manufacturer Advantest , electronics and electric vehicle manufacturer Mitsubishi Electric and electrical equipment manufacturer Mitsubishi Heavy . It also sees potential in Japanese pharma companies like Daiichi Sankyo and Chugai Pharmaceutical . Elsewhere, the bank still favors tech despite increased potential tariffs on Asian exports, saying top picks TSMC , semiconductor giant SK Hynix , infrastructure service provider Quanta Services and smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi remain good bets. — CNBC's Lim Hui Jie contributed to this report.\n",

      "\n",
      "Text: First Solar has tumbled nearly 17% over the past month as the solar sector has broadly sold off in tandem with President-elect Donald Trump's rise, but some analysts see the dip as a buying opportunity. \"As the dust settles, we think FSLR will emerge a winner,\" Michael Blum, an analyst at Wells Fargo, told clients in a Wednesday note. First Solar is the largest manufacturer of solar panels in the U.S. and is rated overweight at Wells Fargo. Republicans will probably seek to repeal some parts of the Inflation Reduction Act if they win both chambers of Congress, according to the Wall Street bank. But the domestic manufacturing tax credits that benefit First Solar are likely to survive because they support jobs in GOP congressional districts, according to the bank. Trump has also threatened stiff tariffs on China, which would benefit First Solar by reducing competition. Tailwinds from tariffs, however, would be offset by headwinds from IRA repeal if the GOP goes after the manufacturing tax credits. In the universe of publicly traded solar stocks, however, analysts view First Solar as best positioned to weather the storm. \"We reiterate our Buy on FSLR due to its domestic manufacturing base,\" Dimple Gosai, a Bank of America analyst, told clients in a note on Wednesday. \"In our view, higher tariffs on imported solar panels would diminish competition from Chinese manufacturers, pushing demand towards First Solar's U.S.-made products.\" Bank of America has a price target of $259 for First Solar, implying about 33% upside from Wednesday's close of $194.02 per share.\n",

He believes JPMorgan is overearning on both net interest income and credit and finds the stock expensive at current trading levels. \"We find that expectations are quite high, with the stock trading at ~2.6x [tangible book value], 15% cap to assets, over 14x 2026 [earnings per share] estimates, and ~10x [pre-provision net revenue] — all close or at all-time highs,\" he wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. \"We know we are fighting the tape here, but believe it makes sense to sell the stock.\" JPM YTD mountain JPM, year-to-date George also noted that, even with a potentially more friendly regulatory environment under a second Trump administration, JPMorgan Chase may not grow its buyback program from here. \"While a more bank-friendly regulatory environment should lead to a greater opportunity for outsized capital return in the near-term, we don't expect JPM to aggressively buy back its stock here,\" he continued. \"At these prices, buybacks simply don't have the impact anyway to EPS and isn't a great use of capital at these levels in our view.\" George's call sets him apart from other analysts on the Street. LSEG data shows 15 of the 24 analysts covering the stock have a buy or strong buy rating.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Dutch tech behemoth ASML has been a favorite among investors in recent years, but Goldman Sachs has adopted a cautious stance on the stock and removed it from its conviction list of top picks. This follows a \"weak earnings update\" in the third quarter, the investment bank's analysts wrote in a Nov. 4 research note. ASML's net bookings for the third quarter were 2.6 billion euros ($2.79 billion), below the 5.6 billion euros penciled in by Wall Street analysts. Net sales, however, came in higher than expectations at 7.5 billion euros. ASML expects net sales for 2025 to come in at the lower of half of the 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros range it previously predicted. Against this backdrop, Goldman's analysts noted that \"visibility on near-term earnings is lower post the 3Q update,\" for ASML. Besides ASML, Goldman also removed brewer Heineken and electronics giant Philips from its Europe conviction list for November, and refreshed it by adding Coca-Cola HBC (Hellenic Bottling Company) and JD Sports . The stocks are featured in the investment bank's \"Conviction List - Directors' Cut,\" which it says offers a \"curated and active\" list of buy-rated stocks. They are selected by a subcommittee in each region which \"collaborate with each sector analyst to identify top ideas that offer a combination of conviction, a differentiated view and high risk-adjusted returns,\" Goldman Sachs says. Coca-Cola HBC Goldman is betting on Coca-Cola HBC, also known as CCH, given its solid top-lines and strong margin uplift. \"CCH's best-in-class execution and innovation pipeline led by Coca-Cola should drive volume growth and positive mix,\" the investment bank noted. CCH is a partner of Coca-Cola and bottles and sells its beverages. The company said its organic revenue was up 13.9% in the third quarter , exceeding the 10.8% penciled by analysts. It now expects organic revenue growth between 11% and 13%, compared with a previous forecast range of 8% to 12%, for the full-year 2024. Analyst Olivier Nicolai expects the company's full-year 2024 and full-year 2025 sales to exceed consensus by 2% and 1% respectively \"driven by his bullish organic sales growth expectations on volume and positive price-mix.\" He is also expecting the CCH to have \"continued positive earnings momentum.\" Shares of CCH are listed on the London Stock Exchange and as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) in the U.S. under the CCHGY ticker. Its shares are up nearly 23.6% year-to-date. Goldman has a 12-month target price of £30 ($41.31) on the stock, implying a 12.6% potential upside. JD Sports Also on Goldman's list is British sneaker and sports fashion retailer JD Sports . The stock is now trading at a \"depressed multiple\" of 9.7 times price-to-earnings, but is \"well-positioned for [a] sportswear recovery,\" the investment bank noted. The comments come as the \"sportswear industry is emerging out of a challenging period, with inventory normalization largely done and high-frequency trackers pointing to retailer markdown activity back in-line with 2019 levels, following a period of elevated discounting\" it wrote. This phenomenon — coupled with an improving product pipeline across brands — has pushed analyst Richard Edwards to an \"above consensus view\" on JD's LFL (like-for-like) sales growth. Edwards also expects space expansion and acquisitions to contribute to an average 10% sales growth from 2025 to 2027, above the consensus average of 7%. Shares of JD Sports are listed on the London Stock Exchange and as an ADR in the U.S. under the JDSPY ticker. Its shares are down nearly 24.2% year-to-date. Goldman has a 12-month target price of £1.90 on the stock, implying nearly 50% potential upside. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "Text: Donald Trump 's decisive victory in the U.S. presidential election has spooked clean energy investors that the Inflation Reduction Act could be on the chopping block. Solar stocks sold off steeply Wednesday in response. Whether the IRA faces a serious threat will depend on whether Republicans secure both houses of Congress. The GOP has won the Senate, but it is still unclear which party will gain a majority in the House of Representatives. Trump's campaign platform says he will seek to terminate the \"Socialist Green New Deal,\" a reference to the IRA. The law has facilitated a clean energy boom in the U.S. The three stocks that have the most exposure to the IRA are Array Technologies , First Solar and SolarEdge , according to a Wednesday note from Goldman Sachs. Array is forecast to receive $80 million in domestic manufacturing tax credits in 2026 or about 35% of the company's estimated non-GAAP earnings per share, according to Goldman. The company, which makes devices that allow solar panels to track, was down nearly 20% on Wednesday. First Solar is projected to book $2 billion in IRA tax credits in 2026 or 70% of its estimated non-GAAP earnings per share, according to Goldman. The solar panel manufacturer tumbled about 11% after Trump's victory. SolarEdge is expected to receive $164 million in IRA tax benefits in 2026 or about 84% of its estimated non-GAAP earnings per share.

GS YTD mountain Goldman Sachs stock. Trump secured a second term by penetrating the so-called Blue Wall and winning Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \"More free markets imply that investment banking revenues have a chance at exceeding 2021 levels over the next few years,\" Mayo said. \"The idea of a capital markets super-cycle seems possible (albeit not a base case), [especially] given the level of pent-up demand, dry powder, and likely more certainty in deals getting approved.\" Banking stocks were broadly higher in trading Wednesday. Shares of Goldman Sachs surged more than 12%, while peers Citigroup , Bank of America and Wells Fargo all gained more than 7% each. \"The chance for more loan growth seems higher now that the election is behind and corporates are likely to have a more 'risk on' attitude,\" Mayo continued. \"This is a key debate given that more loan growth can lead to more [net interest income], revenue, and EPS growth.\" The analyst also noted that Trump's plan for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate could be a \"wildcard\" that also benefits the banking sector.\n",

      "Text: As Wall Street gears up for President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House, one subset of stocks stands to potentially benefit the most from his plan to cut corporate tax rates, according to Goldman Sachs. Trump's victory reduces the political uncertainty hanging over stocks and serves as a near-term catalyst to help drive equities broadly higher, analysts led by Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a research report on Wednesday. Some of that move came the day after Tuesday's election, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 3.6%, the S & P 500 surged 2.5% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped nearly 3%, all of them the largest post-Election Day moves in history. \"Along with the resolution of election uncertainty, resilient recent economic growth data and continued Fed rate cuts support the healthy near-term outlook for U.S. stocks,\" Kostin wrote. Overall, Kostin forecasts the S & P 500 could end the year at 6,015 if the broad market index follows the historical pattern of returning 4% between Election Day in November and year-end. The fate of the U.S. House of Representatives remains to be seen, however, and is key to whether Trump enters the White House with unified government fully in Republican hands, or faces a divided Congress. While several races for House seats remain too close to call, the chamber is leaning toward the GOP, which already wrested control of the Senate on Tuesday. A unified Republican government that swiftly passes Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts could boost Goldman's earnings per share growth forecast for S & P 500 companies by four percentage points, Kostin said. Trump favors slashing the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21%. Goldman forecasts earnings per share growth of 11% in 2025 and 7% in 2026. Previously enacted Trump tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress extends them or approves new legislation. To find a group of beneficiaries from lower corporate tax rates, Goldman screened for stocks that have seen the highest median corporate tax rate over the past 10 years. Companies on the list pay median corporate tax rates higher than the S & P 500 median of 21%. Here is a look at some of the stocks that turned up on Goldman's screen. Disney made the cut. Shares of the entertainment and theme park company have advanced more than about 10% in 2024, lagging the broader market. DIS YTD mountain Disney stock. CEO Bob Iger's media company also has one of the highest 10-year median corporate tax rates found by Goldman, at 29%. Roughly 72% of analysts polled by FactSet carry either a buy or outperform rating on Disney, and their consensus price targets imply 11% upside for the stock over the coming year. Hilton Worldwide Holdings also turned up on Goldman's screen. Shares of the hotel and resort operator have advanced more than 35% in 2024, beating the wider market. Hilton has also paid a 10-year median corporate tax rate of 29%. HLT YTD mountain Hilton Worldwide Holdings stock. Hilton's third-quarter earnings topped Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines last month, although its full-year earnings outlook fell short of forecasts from analysts polled by FactSet. Other names on the Goldman list include Delta Airlines and American Express.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: A Donald Trump presidency and Republican-controlled Senate could boost big banks, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck. To Graseck's point, financials jumped more than 6% on Wednesday — the sector's best day since November 2020 — following Trump's win. Financials were also the top-performing sector on the day as expectations of a deregulatory push and more mergers and acquisitions under Trump buoyed investor sentiment on the sector. The \"U.S. Election points to higher probability of [a] bull case across our coverage as [a] Republican Administration brings with it a stable to lighter regulatory framework,\" Graseck wrote in a Thursday note. While the race for the House of Representatives has not yet been called, House Republicans are optimistic they can maintain a slim majority. If they manage to preserve their control of the House, it would result in a full Republican sweep of the executive and legislative branch, which \"would be an additional accelerant to activity levels,\" per Graseck. The analyst highlighted four big banks investors should look toward: Citigroup, Goldman Sachs , Wells Fargo and Bank of America . Graseck holds an overweight rating on all four stocks. The acceleration in capital markets should benefit all the big banks, and Goldman Sachs is set to benefit the most, she noted. Bank of America is also expected to see gains from an uptick in activity. Goldman is up more than 12% week to date. Meanwhile, Citigroup is most exposed to tailwinds from higher excess capital levels as a Republican-led government is unlikely to raise current capital requirements. Graseck cited Citigroup's ability to buy back stock below tangible book value per share. Citigroup shares have popped 7% this week. Furthermore, \"With the Trump win, our expectation is that the Fed may sit on the Basel 3 Endgame proposal, meaning that current capital rules remain untouched,\" Graseck said. She estimates this will result in an $86 billion jump in current excess capital for the big banks in the firm's coverage. Wells Fargo, which has gained 8% this week, will benefit from the removal of the asset cap, she said.\n",

      "Text: Votes for the U.S. presidential election are being counted , and the early indications point to a victory for former President Donald Trump. As of around 10 p.m. ET, Trump led Vice President Kamala Harris 201-91 in the electoral college. To be sure, there are still many key races in battleground states that are too early to call or too close to call, per NBC News. Stock futures rallied , however, with those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 500 points. Bitcoin, an asset tied to a Trump victory given the candidates courtship of the industry, soared to a record $75,000 . Heading into the election, investors and analysts pointed to several stocks and sectors that could benefit from a Trump win. Here's a roundup of some of those: Steel stocks If Trump regains the presidency, JPMorgan expects steel stocks to outperform . \"A Trump 2.0 scenario would likely bring increased use of tariffs on Chinese and European imports among others, with the first 100 days focusing on Executive authority related to energy and deregulation along with the phased introduction of tariffs,\" JPMorgan analyst Bill Peterson wrote in a note from earlier this month. \"Steels … in particular should rally on a Trump victory assuming greater protectionism would be bullish for U.S. steel pricing, which is already the most attractive globally due to S232 tariffs and largely domestic footprints,\" he added. \"We also see further tariffs benefiting downstream aluminum players.\" Related stocks that could outperform under a Trump victory include Nucor , Cleveland-Cliffs , Kaiser Aluminum and MP Materials , according to Peterson. Financials Bank of America named a Trump presidency under a split government as the best-case scenario for bank stocks. The firm cited expectations of less regulatory oversight under a Trump administration and the potential for more mergers and acquisitions across the sector. The lower probability of tax hikes under Trump would have also been more beneficial for financials, per Bank of America. Financial stocks also dominated UBS's Trump victory stock basket . UBS highlighted more relaxed capital regulation and said investment banks would specifically outperform from more mergers and acquisitions. Among the Swiss-based investment firm's top bank picks for a Trump win were Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and Citizens Financial . Meanwhile, Strategas highlighted Lazard as a stock that could outperform in the mergers and acquisitions space . Wolfe Research added in a Tuesday note that \"under a Trump win and either GOP controlled Congress or split Congress, we expect the Fins sector to be the biggest sectoral winner by far.\" Personality trades Investors have used shares of Trump Media & Technology as a possible proxy for Trump's chances of retaking the presidency. Supporters of Trump have also used the stock as a way to invest in a Trump victory. Shares of Trump Media, the parent company of Trump's social media platform, have soared 94% this year. However, the stock has struggled in recent weeks as Vice President Kamala Harris gained momentum with voters heading into the election. Shares of Trump Media climbed as much as 15% during Election Day, but ultimately ended Tuesday 1.2% lower after being halted during the session for volatility. The stock's volume reached around 147 million shares on Tuesday, much higher than the stock's 30-day average of 52.1 million. Other stocks linked to Trump include mobile software and blockchain company Phunware , which created Trump's campaign app, and Rumble , a video platform focused on conservatives. Tesla is another potential beneficiary due to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with Trump, according to Evercore ISI. Cryptocurrencies A Trump presidency could potentially boost cryptocurrency-linked assets , since the former president has indicated his support for the industry. More favorable regulations could continue to boost digital currencies like bitcoin to new all-time heights . Trump may also expedite approval for cryptocurrency ETFs, which is viewed as a boost for the industry. More broadly, Trump has said he would turn the U.S. into the \"crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.\" BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin year to date. \"Trump has taken a firm pro-crypto stance during his 2024 campaign, underpinned by his promise to 'make Bitcoin great again,'\" Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure wrote in a research note on Monday. In the days leading up to the election, bitcoin prices jumped to a fresh seven-month high as speculation over a potential Trump win grew. \"The markets will take their cue based on who wins the White House. Trump is widely seen as pro-crypto although irrespective of who wins, bitcoin is still primed for a pump,\" said Nic Puckrin, CEO and co-founder of crypto education site Coin Bureau. Dollar The dollar will be critical for investors to follow as election results roll in. Investors widely expect the greenback to become stronger if Trump regains the presidency due to his protectionist policies such as tariffs. \"In times of stress we go to the dollar, at least temporarily, especially if it's global stress and even if it's U.S.-led stress,\" said Jefferies chief market strategist David Zerzos on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" Tuesday morning. \"That will be the most liquid and the most transparent messaging to what we are getting markets to do, because that's where people can put money to work fast.\" Investors have especially bet on the dollar-China trade as a proxy trade for a Trump win, Zerzos added. On the other hand, UBS believes that a higher dollar would be short lived. \"Although the U.S. dollar could strengthen in the near term in the event of a Trump victory, we anticipate medium-term dollar depreciation regardless of the winner and suggest that investors consider using periods of strength to diversify dollar exposure toward other G10 currencies,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer of the Americas at UBS's wealth management division, wrote in a note Monday. \"Fundamentally we believe a combination of the dollar's overvaluation, a shrinking yield advantage over other currencies, and the U.S.'s significant twin fiscal and current account deficits is likely to weigh on the currency regardless of the victor,\" she added. Military & defense stocks Strategas believes that a Trump victory could benefit military and defense stocks such as Axon Enterprise , which provides law enforcement technologies. Trump has stressed his focus on immigration enforcement, making his concerns over undocumented immigrants and the U.S. Southern border a key issue of his campaign. Recently, Trump reiterated his pledge to \"launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.\" To be sure, \"the geopolitical climate supports defense spending, regardless of the outcome,\" JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a client note on Monday. Small caps Trump's willingness to ease up on regulation and cut companies' tax rates could give a boost to small-cap stocks. Investors have increasingly used the group to speculate on Trump's odds of winning. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) rallied in late June, following the debate between Trump and President Joe Biden. IWM YTD mountain iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) year to date A Trump victory would also be \"the biggest catalyst for sustained outperformance for small caps,\" Wolfe Research said in a note on Nov. 1. Trump's domestic-focused agenda and push for deregulation across industries would boost the confidence of small businesses, according to the firm. More mergers and acquisitions would also lift the small-cap universe higher, Wolfe Research added. Oil and Gas Energy stocks — particularly oil and gas producers — were also highlighted as beneficiaries of a second Trump presidency by Evercore ISI. More deregulation and Trump's push toward fossil fuel production would benefit oil giants such as Exxon Mobil and Halliburton , according to the firm. Specifically, the firm said that Halliburton could benefit from \"unleashing\" its domestic energy capacity as the U.S.'s leading pressure pumping firm. Exxon's strategy could receive a boost from capital flow towards more traditional energy sources. U.S.-only retailers Companies that source the largest share of their goods from outside the U.S. could be damaged by Trump's proposed trade tariffs. Throughout his campaign, Trump has made clear his plans to enact universal tariffs as a key economic policy tool should he win office again. These would include a 20% levy on all imported goods and a 60% tariff on products made in China. ULTA YTD mountain Ulta Beauty shares year to date. On the flip side, U.S.-only retailers such as Ulta Beauty could receive a boost under these policies, according to Evercore ISI. \"Trump will be positive for US-only retailers (which have higher tax rates vs retailers with int'l exposure),\" the firm said. \"ULTA has no sourcing from China, and operates in one of the most resilient discretionary categories.\" — CNBC's Michael Bloom, Sean Conlon, Alex Harring, Fred Imbert and Pia Singh contributed to this report.\n",

      "Text: As investors await the results of a tightly contested U.S. presidential election, JPMorgan is eyeing a collection of stocks that is less dependent on the outcome. Voters in the U.S. cast their ballots Tuesday, and the result could send ripples through markets given the different policy stances from both presidential candidates. Against that backdrop, the bank compiled a list of stocks with little exposure to election themes. In other words, they are unlikely to see sharp swings — in either direction — based on who wins the vote. Here is a look at some of the stocks on JPMorgan's list: Expedia made the list.

For months, analysts have weighed the prospect of higher corporate taxes if Vice President Kamala Harris were to win the election. They have also considered the impact of potential tariffs proposed by former President Donald Trump. \"Investors are faced with a choice,\" Roger McNamee, founder of Elevation Partners said Monday on CNBC's \" Squawk on the Street .\" \"On the one hand, you have Harris — who represents a continuation of the economic policies that [helped] create the strongest economic growth of any developed country since the pandemic, but has also combined that with much more rigorous antitrust enforcement,\" he said. \"Contrast that with Trump, who is offering a very different vision.\" .IXIC YTD mountain Tech-heavy Nasdaq performance this year Megacap technology companies have soared to new heights in recent months as investors amp up bets on the artificial intelligence trade. However, those gains have come with some hurdles, including a summer sell-off as sentiment dampened over the payoff from AI. Antitrust and regulatory concerns Investors have kept a close eye on difficulties tech giants are facing as they grow and stoke regulators' concerns around antitrust issues. For instance, in August a judge ruled that Google has a monopoly in internet search. The Justice Department indicated in October that a possible breakup of the company could be an antitrust remedy. Some on Wall Street view a Harris win as a potential obstacle for antitrust and megacap technology stocks. \"Regulatory scrutiny will probably help a lot of M & A activity under Trump — Harris, it'll be a little more of the status quo,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"We already have a roadmap with her, and in this campaign she hasn't really done much to say, 'I'm going to change anything drastically.'\" According to McNamee, heightened antitrust scrutiny could \"unlock a lot of value for investors that currently is stuck inside these companies.\" Chip stocks and tariffs Wall Street is also eyeing the semiconductor industry, a critical sector that could be affected by the outcome of the election. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya notes that the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index has outperformed the S & P 500 on average by 51% and 38% under a Democrat and Republican president, respectively. Trump has already hinted at potential tariffs on the industry. He also called out Taiwan in particular, accusing the country of stealing America's chip industry during a recent interview with Joe Rogan. .SOX YTD mountain Semiconductor index year to date Analysts view this as one of the biggest potential risks for the sector that could hit popular names operating in the PC, server and memory chip markets, Arya said. This could include companies such as Advanced Micro Devices , Qualcomm , Nvidia , and Broadcom . Trump has floated a rate of up to 20% on imports across the board and a 60% tariff on imports from China. \"In the case of a full-blown tariff installment, we expect IT hardware vendors to eat up some of the increased costs, but still increase the price of their products considerably (0-60%?), a potential headwind to overall units,\" Arya wrote. Under a Harris administration, the impact to semiconductors could come in the form of higher corporate tax rates. So far, Trump has hinted at tax cuts for certain companies , while Harris has proposed boost the rate to 28% from today's level of 21%. Nvidia, Texas Instruments , Intel and Qualcomm are among the lower-tax rate beneficiaries at risk if Harris were to boost the rate. If Harris were to win, \"For semis, there would likely be ongoing federal support and incentives for domestic production, while maintaining export controls and investment screening for Chinese firms,\" wrote Ed Mills, managing director and Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. Share buybacks Beyond semiconductors, Bank of America's Brad Sills also noted a potentially higher tax rate on share repurchases under Harris could heighten tax liabilities for big buyback names such as Microsoft , Oracle and Salesforce . The Harris camp is proposing a hike to 4% from 1%.

Meanwhile, a Trump victory could culminate in limited oversight and a \"potential rollback\" of reporting requirements, he said. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives views Trump's proposed tariffs and harsher view on China as a hurdle for supply chains. This could \"slow the pace of the AI revolution,\" he said in a recent post to X that also called a Harris win \"more bullish\" for the industry. Some investors also view Tesla as a likely winner under a Trump administration, given CEO Elon Musk's close ties to the former president. Investors have already come to view it as a proxy for a Trump win, with shares up 28% over the last three months, and that could continue, said Freedom Capital's Woods. Trump's supportive approach to cryptocurrencies could boost prices and benefit names such as Robinhood and Coinbase , noted Wolfe Research's Chris Senyek.

      "Text: Election Day is here, and investors are on edge. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, as well as the battle for Congress, are down to the wire. The outcome will be consequential for markets on many fronts, including dictating policies that could hurt, or boost, different industries, as well as tax and spending plans that will influence the direction of interest rates and the U.S. dollar. \"No election outcome would surprise us at this point,\" wrote Paul Gallant, Washington policy strategist at TD Cowen, in a note last week. \"Battleground states [are] all well within margin-of-error.\" \"For 1st time in history, House & Senate could flip to opposite parties in a single election. Very on brand for 2024,\" Gallant wrote. Generally, a Trump win is seen as positive for financials given a higher likelihood of deregulation for companies in the space. Traditional oil and gas names are also likely to benefit under a second Trump presidency. Under a Harris presidency, clean energy stocks are expected to get a boost as the vice president is likely to keep the Inflation Reduction Act in place. The IRA includes provisions that have sparked a clean energy boom in the U.S. Trump, however, could move to repeal it. As for the broader market, Goldman Sachs broke down how the S & P 500 may trade depending on the outcome. Under a GOP sweep, the bank sees the S & P 500 rallying 3%. A Democratic sweep, however, would spark a 3% sell-off for the benchmark. Smaller stocks are also seen as beneficiaries of a Trump win. CNBC Pro has been breaking down down which stocks could do well under different election scenarios, as well as the market reaction, based on Wall Street research as well as interviews with analysts and investors. Here's what we found in one place: Trump and Harris baskets from Strategas Strategas Research recently compiled two stock baskets . One is made up of stocks that benefit after a Harris win; the other would outperform under a second Trump presidency. \"We continue to believe this is the most investable election of our lifetimes,\" policy analyst Daniel Clifton wrote in a recent note to clients. \"The differences between Trump and Harris are as wide as we have ever seen.\" In the Trump basket are: Axon Enterprise Bank of America Cleveland-Cliffs Strategas pointed to these stocks as Trump beneficiaries, citing the candidate's protectionist stances, including higher tariffs on Chinese steel, as well as the likelihood of deregulation in the financial industry. Harris, in contrast, is less likely to implement higher tariffs — which could boost companies that depend on imported goods like Best Buy. Strategas also sees a Harris win as a boon for clean energy names. In the Harris basket are: Ford Motor Best Buy NextEra Energy AXON YTD mountain AXON in 2024 For more, check out our full story . UBS sees a Harris win as a tactical negative, but some winners would emerge UBS strategist Andrew Garthwaite noted that a Trump victory would be a net positive for the stock market, while a Harris win would put pressure on stocks in the short term. That said, some individual winners would arise under either scenario. Garthwaite said financial services and manufacturing names would do well under Trump, while some tech and solar energy stocks would perform better under Harris. Some stocks in UBS' Trump basket are Goldman Sachs and Cleveland-Cliffs . Apple and Enphase Energy are part of the bank's Harris basket. For more, check out our full story . Playing the energy sector One of the sectors that could see major disruption after the election is energy, especially under a Trump win. If Harris wins, she is expected to preserve the Inflation Reduction Act, which has boosted a transition into renewable energy. However, the IRA passed without GOP support — making it susceptible to a repeal if Trump is victorious. To be sure, the latter scenario hinges on Republicans also obtaining majorities in both the House and Senate. Some stocks and assets to keep an eye on: SolarEdge Technologies Enphase Energy First Solar Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) TAN YTD mountain TAN year to date On the traditional energy front, investors should keep an eye on giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron . For more, check out our story . Retail stocks vulnerable to tariffs Retail stocks could take a hit from higher tariffs given many of them are reliant on imports from China. \"Trump rhetoric on tariffs has already raised concern in many consumer names. He has proposed 10-20% tariffs on most imports, and we've heard levies as high as 60%+ for China. Harris' policy is less clear, but likely more in line with the Biden administration. Pricing is ultimately an offset, but ability to pass this through varies; knock-on geopolitical tension is also concern. The election outcome is a key data point for most exposed names,\" Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow wrote. Boruchow pointed to stocks like Five Below and Target that could be in trouble under a harsher tariff regime. For more, here's the full story . Trump-linked stocks There are also certain stocks poised to directly benefit from a Trump victory, including Trump Media & Technology . Trump Media, which traders under the ticker DJT — also Trump's initials — has more than doubled this year but has also been under pressure recently. Over the past week, the stock has plunged 28%. The stock has served as a proxy for Trump's odds of winning the election — even as polls show him and Harris deadlocked heading into Tuesday's vote. Other stocks linked to Trump are Phunware , a mobile software and blockchain company, along with Rumble , a video platform popular with conservatives. DJT 1M mountain DJT 1-mo chart Check out the full story for more. Don't forget about small caps Small-cap stocks are seen as a potentially major winner under a Trump presidency, given the former president's willingness to roll back regulation and cutting tax rates further for companies. Trading in the group has been somewhat linked to Trump's odds of winning, though not to the extent as shares of Trump Media, for example. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) — which tracks the small-cap Russell 2000 index — soared after Trump's debate against President Joe Biden in late June. Once Harris entered the race the fund consolidated before recovering. IWM 6M mountain iShares Russell 2000 ETF, 6 months As of Tuesday afternoon, the IWM was up more than 10% for the year. Last month, Morgan Stanley broke down its top picks within small caps. Among them are Planet Fitness , Cadence Bank and Viking Therapeutics . All of these stocks are rated overweight by the bank. The crypto trade Crypto has been at the forefront of this election, with Trump signaling his support for the industry in his campaign. Under a Trump presidency, expectations are for digital currencies such as bitcoin to scale to new heights due to a more favorable regulatory regime. A Harris administration, however, isn't seen as favorable for crypto. \"What's driving price action is undoubtedly the election,\" Nic Puckrin, CEO and co-founder at crypto education site Coin Bureau, told CNBC Pro . \"The markets will take their cue based on who wins the White House. Trump is widely seen as pro-crypto although irrespective of who wins, bitcoin is still primed for a pump.\" Some stocks and ETFs to keep an eye on include Coinbase and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) . Coinbase shares are up 12% year to date. IBIT, which launched earlier this year, has popped 30% over the past three months. The dollar The dollar will be a key asset to watch, especially as election results roll in. Many investors see the U.S. currency rising under a Trump presidency with his protectionist policies such as tariffs. UBS, however, thinks this higher dollar would be short lived. \"Although the US dollar could strengthen in the near term in the event of a Trump victory, we anticipate medium-term dollar depreciation regardless of the winner and suggest that investors consider using periods of strength to diversify dollar exposure toward other G10 currencies,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer of the Americas at UBS's wealth management division, wrote in a note Monday. \"Fundamentally we believe a combination of the dollar's overvaluation, a shrinking yield advantage over other currencies, and the US's significant twin fiscal and current account deficits is likely to weigh on the currency regardless of the victor,\" Marcelli said. Financials could be a big winner A Trump presidency would likely lead to regulations being rolled back on the financial services industry, which could lead to big gains ahead. However, a Harris win is expected to keep current regulation measures in place, and possibly introduce new ones. \"From a U.S. post-election positioning perspective, the Financials sector is, by far, the biggest winner under a Trump win from deregulation and higher rates/steeper yield curve,\" Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek wrote. Some stocks to watch in the space include Evercore and Lazard , per Wolfe. Private equity giants KKR and Blackstone would also benefit under a Trump win. Evercore and Lazard are up more than 50% each, while KKR and Blackstone have popped 67% and 28%, respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The U.S. presidential election is here, and a second Trump victory could bring massive changes. During his speech at former President Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally last week, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he would want to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget . This comes as the Republican nominee and former president has promised to appoint Musk as the head of a government efficiency commission, if elected. Due to this, Piper Sandler has unveiled a list of stocks that it views as most sensitive to government spending. The investment bank noted that these names have traded \"very closely\" with election odds. \"If Trump wins, these stocks are likely to be hurt by cuts in government spending,\" Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said in a recent note to clients. \"If [Vice President Kamala] Harris wins, these stocks are likely to benefit.\" Below are some names on the list. For Boeing , 37% of the company's revenue in 2023 came from U.S. government contracts, according to its latest annual report . Shares have already been struggling this year, dropping about 40%. The plane maker had seen most of its airplane production halted since the middle of September as more than 32,000 of its unionized machinists went on strike . In its wake, Boeing launched a stock offering last week to raise up to $22 billion to shore up its finances. To date, a majority of Wall Street is still bullish on the name, with 17 of the 30 analysts covering it having a strong buy or buy rating, per LSEG. Its average price target of $183.58 reflects more than 18% upside from Monday's close. In the defense space, Lockheed Martin could also take a hit with a Trump victory. The company was the top recipient of defense contracts from the Department of Defense in fiscal 2023, being awarded $61.4 billion in defense spending. During September's presidential debate, Trump clashed with Harris over funding efforts, with Harris accusing Trump of being prepared to abandon consistent U.S. support for Ukraine . That said, Lockheed Martin still sees gains ahead, lifting its full-year forecast for earnings per share last month despite missing revenue estimates for the third quarter. Year to date, the stock has already risen nearly 20%. While the Street is split on the name, with 12 of the 24 analysts covering it having a strong buy or buy rating, its average target of $603.83 also implies more than 11% upside ahead, as of Monday's close. A new Trump presidency could also spell cuts to federal health spending . In that area, Humana , which offers Medicare Advantage plans, and UnitedHealth are two names Piper Sandler thinks could be affected. While shares of Humana have plunged more than 44% in 2024, UnitedHealth shares have moved in the opposite direction, gaining about 6%.\n",

      "Title: Bank of America's Trump-Harris playbook: How the stock market will react to the various election scenarios\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Tuesday's U.S. presidential election is the biggest catalyst this week for equities and will set the tone for stocks in the near term, according to Bank of America. But don't expect a big move, equity and quant strategist Ohsung Kwon said. He doesn't expect the S & P 500 to make a move of 2% or more as such a reaction has only occurred a quarter of the time on Election Day for contests going back to 1928. \"We believe implications to equities from the election will be more nuanced than what the headline might suggest,\" Kwon wrote in a Sunday note. \"Profits matter more for stocks than politics and the election will remove the overhang more than anything, in our view.\" Stocks were lower Monday on the eve of the election . Here is how Bank of America suggests trading a variety of Election Day outcomes. Republican clean sweep In the event that former President Donald Trump regains the White House on Tuesday, while Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Kwon forecasts a knee-jerk response for the most regulated aspects of the market. That is because Trump has made deregulation a key piece of his 2025 agenda. These sectors consist of industrial, consumer discretionary and financial stocks. Real estate and technology are among the least-regulated segments, he noted, which could keep the market's reaction somewhat muted in regard to that cohort of stocks. This reaction could fall to the way side over the long-term, Kwon noted, especially if yields begin to rise over investor concern tied to deficit spending and overall U.S. debt in response to tariffs Trump has proposed . Split Republican control A Trump White House with a largely Democratic Congress is overall neutral for equities, Kwon said. With this scenario, the Trump administration could deliver the tariffs the former president has proposed, but his deregulation efforts could be stalled, Kwon added. Democratic clean sweep A win for Vice President Kamala Harris and a Democratic majority in Congress could see corporate taxes rise to 28% from 21%, with a hit to earnings for stocks of as much as 5%, Kwon said. Specific segments that could see an earnings hit include consumer discretionary, communications services and financials. Kwon said BofA would suggest buying the dip on a pullback in stocks in this situation, especially if the Harris administration raises fiscal spending, which could be a growth catalyst for stocks. Split Democratic control The status quo would be maintained with a Harris White House and a Republican Congress, Kwon said. This would shift Wall Street's focus back toward economic fundamentals as well as the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. The strategist said equities have upside in this scenario. Kwon said price momentum for stocks coming out of the election can continue into the next few weeks when judging by history. Over the past seven election cycles, the two-week price direction for stocks was identical to one day after Election Day every single time. Outside of the election, Kwon said the Fed could have ample reason to cut further. He forecasts four interests rate cuts at the next four Federal Open Market Committee meetings moving forward, which aligns with BofA's view of a moderating labor market.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Companies that buy the largest share of their goods from China could be damaged the most by plans to raise tariffs under another Trump presidency, according to Goldman Sachs. With in-person U.S. election voting set for Tuesday, trade and tariff policy remain a key focus for investors. Former President Donald Trump has said he intends to enact universal tariffs as a key economic policy tool should he win office again, including a 20% levy on all imported goods and a 60% tariff on products made in China. Against that backdrop, Goldman Sachs released a list of American retailers that could be most impaired under a Trump presidency, due to the amounts of imported goods sourced from China. Here are some of the stocks on came up on Goldman's screen: Plus-size apparel retailer Torrid , down 42% this year, was one name in the basket. About 95% of Torrid's current sales come from the U.S. However, the retailer has high dependence on Chinese imports, high product elasticity and scores low on its ability to pass higher costs onto consumers. Goldman Sachs analyst Brooke Roach wrote, \"53% of goods were sourced from China as of FY23, though the company is targeting mid-teens by FY24.\" Three of the five analysts covering the stock hold a neutral view. The average price target implies shares of Torrid could rally nearly 85%. Electronics seller Best Buy could also take a hit from Trump's proposed tariffs, since the company currently sources around 60% of its goods from China, Roach said. The company is highly dependent on Chinese imports, has high product elasticity and scores a medium on its ability to pass higher costs onto consumers. Most analysts covering the name are neutral, although the average price target is approximately 12% above Best Buy's current price. Shares of Best Buy have climbed 19% this year. RH , a retailer of upscale home furniture once known as Restoration Hardware, has seen its stock advance 12% this year. The company is highly dependent on Chinese imports and high product elasticity. However, RH also has a greater ability to pass increased costs onto its higher-income shoppers. Sixty-six percent of the company's goods is sourced from Asia, Roach wrote, with 22% from China, 30% from Vietnam and the rest from Indonesia and India. Analysts are generally neutral on RH, with the average price target only 2% above where shares are currently trading. Shares of Floor and Decor have slipped almost 3% in 2024. Approximately 23.5% of the flooring retailer's products are produced in China, making the company highly dependent on Chinese imports. Floor and Decor also has high product elasticity and low ability to pass on costs. However, Roach added that recent news from Floor and Decor seemed to indicate that the company is on the right path to mitigate effects from any potential tariffs. \"In hardlines, we note updated information from Floor and Decor (FND), which has meaningfully reduced their exposure to China since the last round of tariffs and noted on their last earnings call on 10/30 that they are making good progress in bringing this down and as a direct importer, they are at an advantage versus competitors that use brokers,\" she wrote. Analysts are also generally neutral on this stock, with the average price target indicating potential 3% downside over the next 12 months. Finally, Roach highlighted household products retailer SharkNinja and drinkware manufacturer Yeti as two other names that could be impaired by tariff increases. However, both companies are implementing promising plans to diversify their sourcing. \"SN spoke on their 3Q24 call (10/31/24) regarding their decision to accelerate their supply chain diversification outside of China, driving higher near-term [selling, general and administrative spending]. YETI also quantified its China sourcing on its 2Q24 earnings call, where they also highlighted near-term diversification efforts,\" she wrote. \"Net, both companies are looking to materially reduce their reliance on China manufacturing by the end of 2025.\" Shares of SharkNinja and Yeti are 77% higher and 28% lower, respectively, in 2024.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Steel stocks would likely outperform under if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, while clean energy providers might rally if Vice President Kamala Harris captures the presidency, according to JPMorgan. The in-person presidential vote wraps up Tuesday, but more than 78 million voters having already cast their ballots early. Certifying election results could take several more days, extending market uncertainty to the end of the week, but investor concerns will ease once either candidate is declared the winner, JPMorgan said. The outcome is binary as far as sectors of the stock market are concerned. \"A Harris victory would likely imply the status quo for green policies/spending, however with a more hawkish view on foreign policy targeted around strategic sectors like energy transition and AI,\" JPMorgan analyst Bill Peterson wrote in a note on Friday. \"Meanwhile, a Trump 2.0 scenario would likely bring increased use of tariffs on Chinese and European imports among others, with the first 100 days focusing on Executive authority related to energy and deregulation along with the phased introduction of tariffs.\" Clean Energy In the same 14-page report, JPMorgan shared the name of specific companies that are likely to benefit should either candidate prevail. Here are some of the clean energy stocks to consider under a Harris victory, according to JPMorgan: \"We expect the whole of the clean tech universe to rally on a Harris victory, led by EV-exposed names … in response to investor angst around policy/government spending curtailments in each of these areas, which have received significant support\" from the Inflation Reduction Act and Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office, Peterson said. EVgo , which operates electric vehicle charging stations, has already more than doubled this year and could continue to rally under a Democratic president. JPMorgan named EVgo, up 300% in the past six months alone, a top pick. UBS is similarly bullish on the Los Angeles-based renewable energy play. The investment bank recently upgraded EVgo to a buy rating from neutral, with its $8.50 price target corresponding to another 7% increase. \"Upcoming catalysts include announcement of financial close on the DOE loan, updated financial guidance including an increased growth outlook and reaching adj. EBITDA breakeven in 2H25,\" UBS analyst William Grippin wrote. Other stocks that could gain an edge from a Harris presidency include fellow electric vehicle charging station operator ChargePoint and hydrogen fuel cell developer Plug Power , JPMorgan argued. The Wall Street investment bank analyzed the last three presidential election cycles and found that the 100-stock S & P Clean Energy Index historically outperforms the S & P 500 by 5%-6% in the month after a Democratic victory, and underperforms by a similar amount under Republican domination. Steel and aluminum Conversely, Peterson is bullish on steel and aluminum companies if former President Trump gets a second term. \"Steels … in particular should rally on a Trump victory assuming greater protectionism would be bullish for U.S. steel pricing, which is already the most attractive globally due to S232 tariffs and largely domestic footprints,\" he wrote. \"We also see further tariffs benefiting downstream aluminum players.\" Shares of steel producer Nucor have tumbled nearly 18% in 2024 but could bounce back under a Trump victory, according to JPMorgan. In August, Morgan Stanley upgraded the Charlotte-based operator of mini mills to overweight from equal weight. Analyst Carlos De Alba's price target of $176 implies that shares could rise 23% from their Friday close. Nucor \"has de-rated vs. its peers despite the strong earnings growth and robust cash generation we expect in 2025 and 2026,\" the Morgan Stanley analyst wrote. Steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs , which lost out to Nippon Steel last year in the bidding for U.S. Steel, is another potential beneficiary after sliding 35% so far in 2024. Seaport Research Partners upgraded Cleveland-Cliffs to buy from neutral in August and set a $16.50 price target, implying 24% upside over the next 12 months. \"First, the bad news… Given the recent downcycle in steel prices, we have to cut 3Q24 EBITDA and see it probable that consensus will likely lower estimates in the coming weeks,\" said Seaport analyst Martin Englert. \"The good news is that the disciplined and robust supply-side response is still percolating through the market and will become more evident in the near term.\" Other potential winners under a Trump presidency include aluminum producer Kaiser Aluminum and rare-earth materials processor MP Materials , said JPMorgan.\n",

Seeing that the election is already moving various areas of the market, the firm unveiled stock baskets that could outperform depending on the winner. \"We continue to believe this is the most investable election of our lifetimes,\" analyst Daniel Clifton wrote in a recent note to clients. \"The differences between Trump and Harris are as wide as we have ever seen.\" That's because four of the six areas investors are eyeing most are centered around trade, foreign policy, regulation and immigration, he said. Differences in trade policy specifically, he said, are going to \"determine where growth and earnings take place around the world.\" When it comes to trade, Trump's agenda features hardline tariff proposals , especially with regards to China. The Republican nominee said earlier this year he is considering imposing tariffs of 60% or higher on Chinese goods. Under this protectionism stance, Clifton has somewhat of a contrarian stance on which parts of the market could do well. \"The old investment playbook of elections is no longer relevant, Clifton said. \"For example, banks are often cited as the number one investment for a Trump victory. But banks are benefitting from Basel III being watered down and the Fed cutting rates. Instead, tech has been the big winner with Trump.\" Clifton likes Invesco QQQ Trust — an exchange-traded fund that tracks nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq 100 Index — as well as the iShares MSCI India ETF and Cleveland-Cliffs . Those funds have surged more than 18% and 12%, respectively, this year, while Cleveland-Cliffs has fallen 35%. Immigration enforcement is another key area of focus for Trump, as the candidate has fanned concerns over undocumented immigrants and the Southern border , pledging to rectify them by launching the \" largest deportation operation in the history of our country ,\" he said. Clifton thinks Axon Enterprise is a notable beneficiary of this area if Trump wins. The provider of law enforcement technologies has soared about 64% year to date and more than 41% over the past three months. Although Wall Street is largely bullish on the stock, with 14 of the 16 analysts covering it having a strong buy or buy rating, its average price target implies around 3% downside from Thursday's close. Lazard is another notable name for a Trump victory in the mergers and acquisitions space, given that industry members have indicated that a potential Trump administration could be more favorable to merger activity . In 2024, shares have risen more than 52%. In contrast to Trump's trade policy, reduced trade tensions under Harris could lead to gains for FedEx , which has advanced more than 8% this year. Harris has criticized Trump's tariff strategy, calling it the \" Trump sales tax .\" The outcome of the election could also change the trajectory in clean energy, and a Harris victory could mean more stability for the renewable energy tax credits implemented under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. \"I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels,\" Harris said during September's debate. While Trump said during the debate that he is a \"big fan of solar,\" he also criticized the current administration's energy policy, saying \"fossil fuel will be dead\" if he loses this November. Solar stocks rallied after the Street declared Harris the winner of the debate, and one name that Clifton likes in particular is NextEra Energy . Shares of that renewable energy company have gained more than 30% in 2024, and the majority of analysts on the Street are bullish. Among the 24 analysts covering it, 16 have a strong buy or buy rating. Additionally, its average target reflects more than 12% upside, as of Thursday's close. During that debate, Harris also accused Trump of gearing up to abandon support of Ukraine. To date, the U.S. has provided more than $64.1 billion in military assistance since Russia's invasion in 2022. If Harris were to win the election, Clifton believes RTX is a beneficiary of continued U.S. support of Ukraine. RTX shares have moved nearly 44% higher this year.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: With polling forecasting a close race in the U.S. presidential election , UBS is eyeing two baskets of stocks to prepare for either outcome. UBS strategist Andrew Garthwaite said a win for former President Donald Trump would be a net positive for equities, as opposed to a victory for Vice President Kamala Harris , which is seen as a tactical negative. Specifically, Garthwaite expects a Trump administration would lead to U.S. stock outperformance for sectors including financials, due to a potentially more lenient regulatory environment and outsized domestic manufacturing in the event of increased tariffs on imports. Trump's tariff proposal is widely viewed as inflationary , a notion Garthwaite also pointed out in his Oct. 25 note, and could in fact push interest rates higher in the U.S. , according to the Institute of International Finance. A Harris administration, however, could help boost companies that have higher consumer exposure to China as well as firms involved in global trade such as freight companies. Stocks are lower so far this week, with the S & P 500 losing 0.8%. In the week before past elections, the broad market index has typically notched a median gain of 0.76%, per FactSet data . Overall, UBS said stocks within its Trump administration beneficiaries basket indicate a win for the former president next week. Garthwaite cautioned about the unpredictability of elections, as evident in the 2016 U.S. election and the Brexit vote. Here is a look at some of the stocks UBS has placed in each grouping. Financial stocks dominate the Trump list, including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs . Both banks beat third-quarter earnings estimates in early October , with the pair noting growing strength in their investment banking segments. Goldman Sachs notched a 20% increase in investment banking revenue in the third quarter. Stock in the David Solomon-helmed firm has advanced 33% in 2024. GS YTD mountain Goldman Sachs stock. \"Ordinarily, a Trump victory would favour the banks due to potential lighter-touch capital regulation, as well as the investment banks (from increased M & A activity on deregulation) and life companies (from a steeper yield curve),\" Garthwaite said. C YTD mountain Citi stock. Citi stock has gained more than 25% in 2024. One of the areas of the market at risk in the event of a Trump win would be utilities, Garthwaite added, as he predicts higher bond yields, which would serve as a headwind to the sector. He added that utility stocks were among the worst-performing sectors following Trump's 2016 election. Also, a Trump administration could roll back some actions that were favorable to utilities with exposure to renewables. Stocks that could flourish under a Harris administration include clothing and footwear giant Nike . Shares have pulled back 30% in 2024. Nike surpassed Wall Street's estimates for revenue in the first quarter, although the firm withdrew its full-year guidance. NKE YTD mountain Nike stock. Due to the company's exposure to China, a Democratic victory could allow companies in Beijing to breathe a sigh of relief, as a Harris victory would dampen worry over steep tariffs on Chinese imports, Garthwaite said. Other sectors that can benefit from a Harris win include homebuilding as well as child care and employment agencies, Garthwaite added.\n",

      "Text: Three stocks are generating buzz among day traders banking on a Donald Trump victory next week. Retail investors have increasingly focused in on Trump Media & Technology , Rumble and Phunware as stocks that can benefit if the Republican presidential nominee for president prevails. That's already sent the names on wild moves — and they could be in for more as Americans head to the ballot box. Some of these stocks have clearer connections to the former president than others. Trump Media & Technology, which owns the alternative social media platform TruthSocial, trades under a ticker — DJT — that's also the initials for the business mogul-turned-politician. Phunware made Trump's campaign app, while Rumble is a video platform focused on conservatives. To be sure, these trades are considered risky due to high volatility and poor financials. None of these companies turned a profit in 2023. Trump Media, which has the largest market cap of the three, was still less than 25% of median S & P 500 stock size of $37.6 billion. On top of that, few — if any — analysts on Wall Street cover these names. The latest NBC News poll also shows the race between him and Vice President Kamala Harris is in a dead heat. \"Making financial bets based on which stocks you think will do best based on an election outcome is not new,\" said Christopher Schwarz, a finance professor at the University of California Irvine whose research focuses in part on retail traders. But when it comes to names like DJT, \"these stocks have no fundamental reason to be at any price close to the price they're at.\" Still, these names are bound to make headlines and appearances on forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets in the runup to and directly following the election. CNBC compiled more information about these names and what's driving interest from some traders: Trump Media & Technology The TruthSocial parent has gained the most attention given the nominee's stake valued at more than $5 billion as of earlier this week. He holds around 114 million shares, which amounts to ownership of more than half of the company. The stock has seen volatile trading over recent days as voting day draws closer. Shares dove more than 20% on Wednesday, reversing course after jumping more than 8% the day prior. Before Wednesday, the stock had seen a pre-election rally. It pulled the shares out of a slump that at one point sent its price below the $12 mark. On Tuesday, it closed at $51.51. Shares are now more than 160% higher in October, which would mark its first positive month since March. Year to date, they are up more than 140%. Trump Media has seen the highest daily net inflows from retail investors of the year over recent days, according to data analyzed by Vanda Research. That underscores the pour into the name amid the pre-election rally. On Tuesday alone, retail traders were net buyers of Trump Media to the tune of $14.4 million. It's also been the most discussed stock on WallStreetBets, the popular Reddit page for meme stock traders, over the last seven days, according to data from Quiver Quantitative as of Wednesday afternoon. The stock has been named more than 17,000 times on the forum this year, the firm said. The U.S. president and vice president are largely exempt from government conflict of interest rules. Still, Trump would be the first to hold office while controlling a publicly traded company. His DJT holding equates to nearly 75% of his net worth. Trump has said that he has no plans to sell his position. \"There's never been, I don't think, any particular case where the potential future President of the United States probably has such a direct economic impact on particular firms,\" said UC Irvine's Schwarz. Schwarz said there's no reason for Trump Media to even be publicly traded given its business fundamentals and high price-to-sales ratio. Given that, he said trading is based solely on \"speculation.\" \"Trump Media has no fundamental value — it's worthless,\" he said. \"That's why the outcome of the election probably has such a big impact on what the price of the stock is.\" Trump Media reported a loss when looking at net income and EBITDA in 2023. The company had 36 employees as of the end of last year. Phunware and Rumble The other two stocks have a less direct connection to the Republican candidate. Phunware is billed as a mobile software and blockchain company. Beyond the Trump campaign app, Phunware lists Marriott, Atlantis and the Mayo Clinic among clients on its website . The stock has seen major swings over the past year, trading as high as above $24 and as low as below $3. The company employed just 25 people at the end of 2023 and saw losses when looking at net income and EBITDA that year, per FactSet. Phunware has also seen an uptick in net inflows from everyday investors in October, according to Vanda data. Shares have surged more than 140% in the month. It's also up more than 80% in 2024, on track to snap a two-year losing streak. PHUN YTD mountain Phunware, year to date All four analysts polled by LSEG have buy ratings on the stock. The average price target implies shares can rise nearly 90% above the $15 mark. To be sure, price target estimates vary widely within this group — from as low as $8 to as high as $20. Rumble, on the other hand, hasn't seen a similar spike as Nov. 5 gets closer. Still, the company is viewed as a Trump-connected play given its video platform that's popular among conservatives. The company employed just under 160 people at the end of last year and also posted losses on net income and EBITDA in the year. It went public in September 2022 with the backing of PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel. Shares have risen 13% in October, bringing its year to date gain to 36%. Shares have traded within a tighter range over the last 52 weeks, sitting between $3.33 and $9.20. The two analysts surveyed by LSEG both have hold ratings on the stock. Both have an $8 price target, which suggests shares can climb more than 34% over the next year. — CNBC's Robert Frank and Fred Imbert contributed to this report.\n",

      "Text: The outcome of this year's presidential election could bode well for different parts of the stock market, according to Evercore ISI. The firm ran a quantitative screen of its top stock picks under a victory scenario in which Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris would win, and another in which Republican candidate Donald Trump emerges victorious. Both candidates are in a dead heat heading into next week's election, according to an NBC News poll released earlier this month . Here are the names Evercore ISI analysts think could benefit under either White House scenario: Winners under a second Trump presidency are in sectors of the market that would benefit most from a deregulatory push, namely financials and oil and gas companies, according to Emanuel. Losers would lie within sectors that are most exposed to Trump's renewed bigger trade wars, including autos and agriculture, he noted. Halliburton and Exxon Mobil are two energy stocks that could get a boost from Trump's push to further solidify the U.S.' dominance in fossil fuel production. The U.S. is already the world's largest oil and gas producer. Halliburton would benefit from \"unleashing\" domestic energy capacity as the country's dominant pressure pumping company, Evercore ISI thinks. Oil and gas giant Exxon would also see capital flow to traditional energy sources, benefitting the company's strategy. Halliburton shares are down 22% this year, while Exxon has added 17%. Ulta Beauty could also see tailwinds from a second Trump presidency, as it could lead to more tariffs on Chinese imports. \"Trump will be positive for US-only retailers (which have higher tax rates vs retailers with int'l exposure),\" Evercore ISI said. \"ULTA has no sourcing from China, and operates in one of the most resilient discretionary categories.\" Ulta's stock is down 22% year to date. Shares have been under pressure since the specialty retailer cut its full-year 2024 forecast in August. Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell said earlier this month that the company is grappling with tougher competition and a more volatile consumer — but reiterated confidence in long-term growth. Tesla 's another potential beneficiary given Tesla CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with Trump, according to the firm. The electric vehicle maker's shares are up 4.4% year to date. Under a Harris win, these stocks could benefit, per Evercore ISI: Evercore ISI forecasts Harris winners to be renewable energy and EV companies, as that administration is expected to maintain the Inflation Reduction Act and other clean energy policies. Health insurance companies linked to Affordable Care Act and Medicaid should also benefit, as Harris is expected to boost enrollment in those programs rather than let them expire at the end of 2025. NextEra Energy is a name that could benefit from the certainty of tax credit extensions for renewables under Harris. Discount retailers such as Burlington and Ross Stores are another likely beneficiary of a Democratic win, according to Evercore ISI. \"A blue sweep would likely benefit the lowest income consumers and within our space, BURL has the lowest income demographics AND a bigger margin opportunity than ROST,\" Emanuel said about the two outperform-rated stocks. Burlington shares have raced past the broader market this year, gaining nearly 31%. Analysts polled by LSEG think there's more room to go for the department store, with the average price target indicating upside of more than 20%. Ross, meanwhile, is flat for the year. A slew of tech companies, namely Apple , Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise , could fare well with a Harris win given the risk of lower tariffs. Cybersecurity giants Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike could also benefit from increased investments in infrastructure for maritime ports, power grids, water supply and communication networks that are likely to continue under a Harris presidency, per Evercore ISI. \"Biden/Harris have already allocated funding for cybersecurity defenses for state and local governments to modernize their network security and is likely to push for further federal investments in securing national infrastructure which has been part of his agenda,\" Emanuel said.\n",

      "Text: The energy sector could face disruption if Donald Trump wins a second presidential term eight days from now, with clean energy investors likely to face volatile trading, particularly if the outcome of the election remains unclear well beyond Nov. 5. Trump has built a small lead over Vice President Kamala Harris as the campaign enters the final week, though the race is within the margin of error, according to CNBC's most recent national poll . The candidates are in a dead heat in the \"blue wall\" states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. A Harris victory is expected to largely preserve the status quo of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which has accelerated the transition to renewable energy resources. A Trump win, on the other hand, could bring disruption, though this will depend on whether the Republican Party also sweeps Congress. The former president is threatening to terminate the IRA, or what he calls the \"Socialist Green New Deal,\" according to his campaign platform. Solar stocks have broadly sold off in October as the polls have tightened, with shares of First Solar and Enphase down more than 20%. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) and the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) have tumbled more than 9% and 10%, respectively. \"We expect outsized volatility following the election on the back of investor positioning, especially in the case of a red (Republican) or blue (Democratic) sweep, as markets react to potential shifts in fiscal policy,\" Dimple Gosai, an analyst at Bank of America, told clients in a note this month. Trump's support for fossil fuels is unqualified. He has boiled his energy agenda down to three words: \"drill, baby, drill.\" While Trump's platform says he wants to unleash production from all sources, the document specifically calls out oil, gas and nuclear. Nowhere does his platform mention solar or wind power. How voters perceive the two candidates' energy policies could end up playing an influential role in the outcome of the election altogether. Natural gas is an important industry in Pennsylvania, the crown jewel of the campaign with its 19 Electoral College votes. Whoever wins the Keystone State will likely become the country's next president. While Harris has abandoned her previous opposition to fracking, it's unclear if her shift to the center on natural gas will help push her over the finish line in Pennsylvania. Clean energy Executives of publicly traded solar companies are confident that tax benefits will remain in place regardless of who wins in November. This is because the clean energy manufacturing boom has disproportionately benefited Republican congressional districts . While the election will bring short-term volatility, the solar industry remains well-positioned for long-term growth, according to Bank of America. Wind and solar deployments actually grew by 28% under Trump compared with President Barack Obama 's second term, indicating that the expansion of renewable energy is increasingly driven by the market, according to Bank of America. The IRA, however, passed without any Republican support and there is a risk of repeal if the GOP sweeps Congress. Trump wants to make the tax cuts passed during his first term permanent. Republicans could seek to repeal the IRA to free up money to finance those tax cuts. Trump has also floated the idea of up to 20% tariffs on all imports and 60% or more on goods from China, which would hurt solar companies that do not have a strong domestic supply chain. In a repeal scenario, residential solar installations would become more expensive and less attractive to consumers, with companies such as Enphase and SolarEdge likely taking a hit, according to Bank of America. The end of benefits for domestically sourced content and higher tariffs would also inflate the cost of utility-scale solar and battery projects, hurting Array , Fluence and NextTracker , according to the bank. First Solar is widely regarded by analysts as the renewable stock that is best positioned to weather the election regardless of the outcome. The solar panel maker has a domestic manufacturing base that would insulate its business from Trump tariffs, according to Bank of America. The company could add customers as Chinese competitors are pushed out of the market, according to the bank. FSLR YTD mountain First Solar shares year to date. A lot will depend, however, whether there is divided government. A Democratic Congress would likely prevent a full repeal of the IRA, according to Bank of America. \"A Harris victory or Dem win in the House could alternatively spur a massive relief rally,\" Steve Fleishman, an analyst at Wolfe Research, told clients in a note this month. \"We recommend investors keep powder dry and be ready to take advantage of potential opportunities.\" Fossil fuels Despite Trump's rhetoric, the election will probably have a marginal impact on the oil and gas industry, according to Roger Read, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. Oil and gas production was solid from Obama's second term through the Trump and Biden administrations, Read said. Though Harris supported banning fracking during her bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential primary, the U.S. has produced record amounts of oil and natural gas under the Biden administration. Oil production has remained strong across administrations because of the facts on the ground, according to Read. The shale revolution has unlocked a resource that the industry can exploit at an economic advantage, according to the analyst. A Trump administration could make permitting new production on federal land in New Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska easier, benefiting the producers and ultimately pipeline companies, Read said. The vast majority of shale acreage in the U.S., however, is on private land, according to a Morgan Stanley report from August. About 25% of oil and 10% of natural gas production is on federal land and waters, according to the bank. \"While it's easy enough to say that under a Trump administration regulations will be a little easier, both in the permitting side and adding the necessary infrastructure, it's not in the way we look at it as a game changer,\" Read told CNBC. A Trump victory could have an impact on global oil prices through tighter sanctions on Iran. The Biden administration has eased back on oil sanctions enforcement against Tehran, allowing the Islamic Republic's crude exports to rebound by nearly 1 million barrels per day, according to Morgan Stanley. The resumption of so-called maximum pressure by Trump could take several hundred thousand barrels of Iranian oil off the global market, according to Morgan Stanley. This would benefit the oil majors Exxon and Chevron, whose stocks typically follow the trajectory of crude prices.\n",

      "Text: Farmer sentiment is at its lowest point in nearly a decade, complicating an already tricky investment landscape ahead of a tight U.S. presidential election. In the face of weakening income expectations, farmer sentiment in September reached its lowest levels since March 2016 — driven in part by worries around the U.S. presidential election — according to the latest reading from the Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer. In fact, 78% of the 400 agricultural producers assessed in the survey — which tracks the health of the agricultural economy in the U.S. — expressed concern that changes in government policy following November's election could potentially worsen an already difficult environment. Farmers are much less confident now than they were a year ago about their finances. Specifically, the report showed that the farmers' financial expectations index dropped 18 points to 68 compared to the prior-year period. This would mark the third month in a row of declining expectations. And for the first time since 2020, more farmers expect farmland values to go down rather than up. James Mintert, director of Purdue University's Center for Commercial Agriculture, expects land values to likely flatten in the short term. In the long term, conditions could get even worse if commodity prices continue to fall amid supply outpacing growth and demand, he added. \"People are clearly less optimistic about land values now than they were a year ago, two years ago and especially three years ago,\" Mintert told CNBC. \"If this cost-price squeeze in commodity prices continues, there's a good chance we'll see some softness develop in the land market.\" This comes as a recent NBC News poll shows former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in a dead heat ahead of the Nov. 5 election, making it unclear how the agriculture space could be further affected. Growing uncertainty On top of high input costs and low commodity prices, anxiety about changes to regulation and taxes are fueling this waning sentiment among producers, according to Michael Langemeier, the associate director of the Purdue center. \"They're really worried about changes in the estate tax,\" Langemeier said. Higher estate tax exemptions approved under the Trump administration's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are set to expire next year. \"Land values are very high right now, and the estate tax amounts that are excluded from estates, that amount is set to decline after 2025.\" Beyond that, he noted that farmers are worried in general about the farm safety net — or the lack thereof. To date, the federal government has yet to renew the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, which provides producers with things such as federal crop insurance and commodity support programs, farm loans and disaster assistance. \"Until that's actually signed, sealed and delivered, they're going to be a little concerned on potential cuts in the safety net,\" Langemeier said. Kristen Owen, an analyst covering sustainable growth and resource optimization at Oppenheimer, said she thinks a new farm bill will likely not be enacted until 2025. That's also when key policies through the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act are put into action. Owen underscored there are questions surrounding what will happen to the law's tax credits that affect the farming sector under either a Trump or Harris administration. The difference in both candidates' trade and tariff policies is another big factor, she said. Trump's economic platform features hardline tariff proposals . The Republican nominee also threatened in October to slap manufacturer Deere with a 200% tariff if it moves some of its factories to Mexico. Harris criticized Trump's tariff stance in a debate in September , calling it the \"Trump sales tax.\" She added: \"Let's be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we've ever seen in the history of America.\" \"There is a lot of uncertainty for the farm economy,\" Owen added. \"The election is not necessarily going to be that catalyst that creates more certainty.\" Despite that, the outlook for some of the agriculture players is still bright, even if the outlook for the farming sector isn't. Stocks to watch Though Owen doesn't expect a sweep for either political party in November, the analyst is eyeing industrial giant Caterpillar as a direct beneficiary of a Republican victory. \"Caterpillar is sort of the bellwether for industrial activities,\" she said. \"It also benefits from some of the tax policies that have been supported by the Trump administration [in] the past, including things like accelerated depreciation [and] lower corporate tax rates.\" And while reshoring is likely to work under the administration of either presidential candidate this election, Owen sees that trend and the support for domestic industrial policy under a potential Trump administration as other catalysts for share growth as well. CAT YTD mountain CAT, year-to-date Deere could also respond favorably in the short term to a Republican sweep, Owen said. However, she emphasized that any gains will likely fade pretty quickly due to the aforementioned uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's trade policies in particular, especially with respect to China. \"The 2019-2020 [trade] war with China actually delayed the equipment purchasing cycle by probably two years,\" Owen said. \"Farmers got Trump bucks in return, but that wasn't sufficient for overcoming the uncertainty created by having just a lack of market access.\" Cerity Partners' Jim Lebenthal is sticking with Deere regardless of the outcome of the election. He thinks its current share price suggests that agricultural prices may have hit a trough. \"Management gets a high mark for how they're handling a tough macro situation by limiting production,\" the firm's partner and chief equity strategist said in an interview. \"If the bottom is in, they do have some gains ahead of them.\" DE YTD mountain DE, year-to-date Both Caterpillar and Deere have hit fresh 52-week highs in October. Year to date, Caterpillar has popped more than 30%, while Deere has risen around 2%. Owen said under a Democratic win, shares of Green Plains could do well — that among the names she covers it has the highest exposure to IRA tax benefits, which she said primarily come through renewable fuels. \"More of those policies that tend to be aligned with clean energy sources would benefit from a lack of that pressure from the Republicans,\" she added. The stock has struggled in 2024, losing more than 54%.\n",

      "\n",
      "Text: A host of retailers are at risk of higher costs and lower sales from former President Donald Trump returns to the White House and the imposed more tariffs on imported goods, Wells Fargo researchers said. Analyst Ike Boruchow and the bank's consumer team found the tariffs proposed by the Republican nominee are likely a significant challenge for retailers. Trump has discussed a 20% tariff on all goods from all countries, as well as a 60% rate on imports from China. Boruchow and his team looked at variables including exposure to China when scanning for retailers that most at risk. Here are four they found: Five Below was one discounter that Boruchow put on watch. High tariffs would be the latest hit after what has already been a tough year, with shares of the value-focused retailer diving 59% in 2024. If that holds, it would be the Phaildelphia-based company's worst year on record. Despite Wells Fargo's concern, Wall Street expects a bounce ahead. Though the average analyst surveyed by LSEG only has a hold rating, their consensus price target implies Five Below shares can rebound by more than 20%. Target is an even larger retailer that Wells Fargo is concerned will suffer from high tariffs enacted in a second Trump term. The stock has fared better than Five Below, but is still underperforming the broader market this year, rising 6%. The majority of analysts hold a buy rating on Minneapolis-based Target, according to LSEG. The average price target suggests the stock will advance close to 18% over the coming year. .SPX FIVE,TGT YTD mountain Five Below and Target vs. S & P 500, year to date Even might Walmart could see higher tariffs as a negative after what's shaping up to be a stellar year.

After this monster run, the average analyst only foresees further upside of about 2.5% for Walmart over the next year, the LSEG survey says.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Stocks with higher exposure to overseas operations could underperform under a Republican presidency, according to Wolfe Research. Less than two weeks are left until the U.S. presidential election. A Democratic versus Republican win could mean vastly different outcomes for investors. Republican nominee Donald Trump has expressed that should he regain the presidency, he will establish universal tariffs as a key economic policy tool. The former president has already proposed a 20% tariff on all imported goods and a higher 60% rate on Chinese products. Against this backdrop, Wolfe Research released a basket of stocks that might be impaired under a Trump presidency. These companies would be at risk either under a 10% universal duty or 60% China tariffs. Here were a few stocks from the list: Tariffs could be a headwind for clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters , which has dipped 7% this year. Analysts are mostly neutral on the stock, with seven of the 11 covering the name rating it as a hold, according to LSEG. However, the average price target implies American Eagle stock could rise 21% from here. In a recent note, Bank of America analysts similarly highlighted American Eagle as a stock that is sensitive to tariffs on China. \"Tariffs would likely increase inflation and could dampen consumer spending,\" the bank wrote. Beauty and cosmetics manufacturer Estée Lauder , down about 40% this year, could also face repercussions under a Trump win. Last week, HSBC downgraded the name to a hold rating from buy on the back of concerns about the China market. \"Recent trip to Greater China and warnings in the beauty segment point to an excessive optimism on our part,\" the firm wrote. \"Restructuring ongoing with morale likely leading to staff leakage and lack of external hire as CEO now our base case.\" Analyst Erwan Rambourg lowered his target price on the stock to $100 from $130. This updated forecast implies shares of Estée Lauder could rise about 14% from their Wednesday close. Analysts are similarly overwhelmingly neutral on the name, but on average still believe the stock could rise 19% from its current levels, per LSEG. Caterpillar was another name on Wolfe's list. Shares of the engineering equipment manufacturer have rallied 30% in 2024. Earlier in October, Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight, citing mounting pressures in the company's construction industries segment. Analyst Angel Castillo's revised price target of $332, down from $349, is approximately 14% lower than where shares closed Wednesday. About half the analysts covering the stock have assigned it a hold rating, according to LSEG. The average price target implies Caterpillar could slide 7%. Other than these stocks sensitive to tariffs, Wolfe Research also suggested a few other ways to play the election. For instance, financials, U.S. industrials, energy and crypto stocks such as Goldman Sachs , Robinhood , Coinbase and Patterson-UTI Energy would likely outperform in the case of a Trump win. If Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the next president instead, Wolfe's favored stocks to buy would include NextEra Energy , Centene and AES Corp .\n",

      "Text: BMO Capital Markets dropped its 2024 election guide last week. The firm found stocks in different sectors that stand to gain or lose depending on which party wins the White House. BMO looked mainly at potential effects tied to tariffs, regulation, immigration, taxation and socially conscious business frameworks. \"We are not taking a view on the election outcome but rather sharing our views from a policy perspective,\" the firm said. CNBC Pro compiled some names BMO sees as winning in both scenarios. Kamala Harris victory Brookfield Renewable is one name that could be a winner if Harris prevails. That is because it is seen as a beneficiary of support for renewable energy. Shares have underperformed the broader market this year with a gain of 8%. Despite that, Wall Street is bullish on the stock. The majority of analysts polled by LSEG have a buy rating, with a price target implying shares can rise more than 6%. Dollar Tree is one name that could see a \"relief rally\" if Democrats win the White House. Shares have dropped more than 50% this year but Wall Street expects a rebound ahead. The average price target of analysts polled by LSEG implies shares can bounce more than 25%. Still, the typical analyst has a hold rating. Donald Trump victory If Trump wins a second term, Dow could get a boost along with other U.S. commodity producers. The blue-chip stock has slipped more than 5% in 2024, making it one of the worst performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year. Analysts see an upside of more than 10% on the horizon, according to LSEG. But the typical analyst has a hold rating. Adtalem Global is another name that can benefit under Trump as relaxed regulations should help for-profit education. The health-care education stock has jumped more than 22% this year.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The U.S. election is about two weeks away – and who winds up in the White House and in Congress could have an impact on key corners of the stock market, according to Bank of America. \"Profits accelerating are far more important than who is sitting in the Oval Office. But politics can make or break sub-sectors,\" the firm wrote in a Friday note. With this in mind and with volatility expected to rise as the Nov. 5 election nears, Bank of America strategists say it's now a stock picker's market. \"Now is not the time to close one's eyes and buy the index,\" the investment bank said. Here are some of the ways Bank of America analysts think the upcoming election results could affect the stock market. Harris presidency, split government A victory for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the White House, plus a Republican-controlled Congress, could be \"the best outcome\" for online media companies, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. He noted that Harris is likely to enforce a potential ban on TikTok — which could boost Meta Platforms and Snapchat . META YTD mountain Meta Platforms in 2024 \"While a Democrat-led [Department of Justice] will likely continue to bring more antitrust pressure to the Big-3 ( GOOGL , META, & AMZN ), a split congress is less likely to pass legislation that could change [the] current operating environment,\" Post wrote. Meanwhile, Harris' plan to increase corporate income taxes to 28% from the current level of 21% would likely pose a headwind to retailers that have high domestic exposure, according to analyst Lorraine Hutchinson. During Donald Trump's first term in office, his corporate tax rate cut — the opposite scenario — led to most businesses re-investing the savings in their businesses, per Hutchinson. Some stocks exposed to this risk include clothing retailers such as Lululemon Athletica , American Eagle Outfitters , Gap and Urban Outfitters . Beauty retailer Ulta and discount chain Five Below may also be hurt, according to the analyst. Health-care facility stocks such as Tenet Healthcare and Universal Health Services could also benefit as Harris would likely work to expand Medicaid coverage — a boost for providers, said analyst Joanna Gajuk. To be sure, managed care companies may be negatively affected by changes to Medicare Advantage under Harris. \"Democrats have been more focused on potential overpayments and implementation of more regulations to govern how business is run. President does not need congress to influence rates and regulations,\" Gajuk wrote. She added that UnitedHealth Group , Agilon Health and Humana could see some downsides from this case. Harris presidency, Democratic party sweep Meanwhile, full Democratic party control of the executive and legislative branches could result in a significant increase in telecom and cable policy regulation, per analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich. \"Under this scenario, we also believe media companies would likely be prevented from carrying out much needed consolidation,\" Ehrlich said. Big Tech would also experience more aggressive regulatory pressure under Harris and a Democratic-led Congress, the firm added. Smaller-cap media and e-commerce companies are potential winners under this case, as well as Snapchat, Meta and Alphabet in the short term if a TikTok ban is enforced, per internet analyst Post. Meanwhile, tech companies centered around the gig economy such as Uber and Lyft are at risk, he added. For the payments sector, a Democratic sweep \"would be the worst-case scenario,\" said analyst Jason Kupferberg. \"If the White House and Congress are politically aligned, passage of new legislation would likely be easier,\" Kupferberg said. He referred to Democratic Senator Dick Durbin's proposed Credit Card Competition Act , which would introduce higher competition in the U.S. credit card sector if it were to be passed. Trump president, split government A win for Republican candidate Donald Trump and a split government would be the best-case scenario for bank stocks, per analyst Ebrahim Poonawala. \"A Republican win with divided Congress should serve as a sentiment positive for bank stocks given the reduced risk of onerous regulations, potential for a pick-up in M & A activity (bank M & A and larger deal activity across S & P sectors) and less likelihood of tax hikes that could dampen economic activity,\" Poonawala wrote. This election scenario would also likely result in compromises over the Inflation Reduction Act and potentially result in wins for both Democrats and Republicans — and investors do not expect a total repeal of the IRA under Trump, according to analyst Dimple Gosai. For managed care stocks with ties to health insurance exchanges and Medicaid, a Trump presidency and a divided government would likely pose a headwind, said Gajuk. She added that Trump could potentially undermine funding and enrollment for Medicaid. Further, Trump will likely call for an end of enhanced Affordable Care Act exchange subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025 . There will likely be pushback from Congress. This scenario could be a negative one for Oscar Health and Centene , per Gajuk. On the other hand, a Trump presidency would be viewed positively by gig-economy companies, including Uber and Lyft, according to analyst Post. The \"GOP is perceived as pro-growth for a high-growth sector and a divided congress is less likely to pass a new employment legislation/revival of PRO Act,\" he wrote. The Protecting the Right to Organize, or PRO, Act is a proposed legislation aimed at increasing labor unions' rights and worker protections. E-commerce companies could also possibly see tailwinds from higher tariffs on China proposed by Trump, Post added. Trump president, Republican party sweep Under this case, lower regulation and potential reforms aimed at weakening the Securities and Exchange Commission's market structure rules would be a boost for diversified financial companies, said analyst Craig Siegenthaler. However, full Republican control would likely result in higher volatility and deficits for asset managers, brokers and exchanges. \"This could hurt most names excluding CME / CBOE which benefit from volatility,\" Siegenthaler wrote. Live Nation Entertainment , which is the target of an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice, would benefit from Trump and the Republican party's less-aggressive stance on antitrust enforcement, analyst Ehrlich added. Homebuilders are also at risk if the Republican party sweeps Washington. \"We do see some risk that the construction industry relies heavily on foreign trade labor and tighter immigration or deportation could create labor shortages,\" analyst Rafe Jadrosich wrote. Meanwhile, more tax cuts and near-shoring efforts — as well as a likely weaker dollar — could help paperboard and packaging companies such as Smurfit WestRock , Packaging Corporation of America and Graphic Packaging . For retailers, Trump's proposed increased tariffs on China would be the most negative for Skechers , Crocs and American Eagle Outfitters, according to the firm. —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n",

      "\n",
      "Text: While other stocks in the technology sector have been trending steadily higher, shares of Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) have been decidedly rangebound for pretty much the entirety of 2024. But after a strong October, TTWO appears to be setting up for a significant breakout that yields a healthy upside price target. After reaching a peak of around $170 in early February, the stock pulled back to just below its 200-day moving average. Over the next six months, TTWO experienced numerous tests of previous support in the $135-$140 range, always bouncing higher off this zone of support. The relative strength of TTWO vs. the S & P 500 has been fairly weak through 2024, given the resilient uptrend demonstrated by other growth stocks while Take-Two was languishing in a price range. We've recently detected an improvement in price momentum, fueling another retest of price resistance around $170. As legendary technical analyst Alan Shaw used to say, \"The broader the base, the higher in space.\" So a break above this key resistance level would imply much further upside for this software name. We can determine an initial upside target simply by measuring the price range of the basing pattern, in this case from $140 to $170. Assuming a similar move to the upside post-breakout, that would yield a minimum upside target of around $200. A move of that magnitude would certainly confirm a new bullish phase for TTWO. Looking at the weekly chart, we can see that the upper end of the recent price range is part of a much larger price structure going back to 2021. TTWO peaked at around $215 in February 2021 before plunging to a low just below $90 during the COVID era. 2023 saw a dramatic reversal of fortune, as Take-Two moved all the way back up to a 61.8% retracement of the 2021-2022 decline. That 61.8% retracement sits right around $167, forming the upper end of the price range we outlined on the daily chart. So a breakout above $170, while an important signal on the daily chart based on the basing pattern, also represents a significant break above a major Fibonacci retracement level. Based on Fibonacci analysis, a confirmed break of the 61.8% resistance level would imply a retest of the previous high around $215. Given the structure on the weekly chart, along with the pattern measurements on the daily chart, it appears that a push above $170 could mean much further upside for Take-Two. If TTWO would fail to gain a foothold above $170, then the basing pattern on the daily chart would come back into play, suggesting downside support at the 200-day moving average as well as the lower end of the basing pattern. But assuming a breakout does play out this week, it appears that TTWO has much further upside in store into year-end 2024. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

      "Text: Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS) are the two largest publicly traded companies in the children's toy industry. For those interested in investing in this segment of the market, technical analysis is useful in determining which of the two stocks may be better positioned. Long/short equity fund managers often pair the two stocks against each other, contributing to their sometimes-divergent trends. HAS launched a cyclical uptrend late last year, clearing resistance from its weekly cloud model in April in a long-term bullish development. The upward sloping cloud and 40-week moving average suggest that the primary trend is bullish. However, in response to its recent earnings report, HAS flashed intermediate-term 'sell' signals from the DeMark Indicators and the MACD. We see this as a setback for the stock over the next several weeks, increasing risk of deeper pullback. Support is near $61. Mattel's outlook? Unlike HAS, a cyclical uptrend has yet to develop in MAT, but it recently cleared a long-term downtrend line and the weekly cloud in a bullish reversal. The breakout in MAT is associated with positive intermediate- and long-term momentum, evident in the weekly and monthly MACDs, both of which are conducive to upside follow-through in the coming weeks. Next major resistance for MAT is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level near $22.50. The cloud puts initial support near $19.40. While HAS was the first of the two stocks to reverse its long-term downtrend, it became overextended and appears to be giving over its leadership stronghold to MAT, which has a newer positive technical catalyst. The setup supports outperformance from MAT in the months ahead. This is reflected in the ratio of MAT to HAS , which has a confirmed counter-trend 'buy' signal and room to resistance. The 10-week MA has turned higher to indicate intermediate-term momentum has shifted in favor of MAT. In an uncertain market environment, this view may be best expressed via a \"pair trade\", where a long MAT position is offset by a short HAS position, ideally with the backing of fundamental analysis. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .

      "Text: Exxon Mobil (XOM) is a range-bound stock judged that is fully rested and in a position to come to life in the weeks or months ahead. Advancing from $33 at its March 2020 Covid low to $117 in March of 2023 (+$84... +250%)... XOM has been trading in a tight range, consolidating (read: resting) following the preceding strong advance. By our work, XOM is now in position to reassert itself to the upside. A breakout from current levels implies a move to the $128+/- level. Exxon, as all will know, is a large, liquid defensive stock, that has paid an annual dividend since 1978 (46 years) and has increased its dividend payout every year except in 2020 (Covid) when it left the dividend unchanged. The current dividend yield is 3.39% vs the 1.29% yield for the S & P 500 Index.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: With the Magnificent 7 stocks floundering this week, and about 30% of the S & P 500 members breaking below their 50-day moving average in October, where can investors find emerging strength? The financial sector has been the best performing sector in October, and the chart of Visa (V) suggests this payment processor may just be getting started. Over the last eight months, Visa has been building up a \"cup and handle\" pattern, formed by a long rounded bottoming pattern and then a brief shallow pullback. This type of pattern will often emerge after a bullish phase, and represents a long consolidation period before a new breakout signals a renewed bull trend. The key to this particular pattern is a fairly stable resistance level, which is evident on the chart of Visa with numerous tests of the $290 level since March 2024. If and when the price finally breaks above this resistance level, this implies an influx of buying power with the potential to move the price much higher. That breakout finally occurred this week, with an earnings-fueled upside gap finally pushing V above that $290 threshold. The structure of the daily chart remains positive as long as Visa remains above the $290 price point, which now serves as potential support. Below that level, we're watching the 50-day moving average which has lined up with recent swing lows in September and October. The weekly chart of Visa shows how this week's breakout is just the latest sign of a bullish follow-through for the stock. Back in November 2023, we observed a similar big base breakout as V powered through its 2021 and gained an additional 18% into early 2024. The weekly RSI has remained above 40 during pullbacks in October 2023 and June 2024, demonstrating that the overall momentum picture remains bullish on the long-term time frame. You may notice that the RSI behaved quite differently in 2022, when a primary downtrend for Visa resulted in an RSI remaining below 60 on rallies. The bottom panel shows the weekly PPO, which generated a buy signal in late August 2024. Similar to the buy signal in November 2023, we see this as a sign of renewed bullish sentiment for Visa. And as long as Visa remains above moving average support, this payment processor could be headed to much further gains into early 2025. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

      "Title: Ether is set to gain ground on bitcoin with charts indicating 20% upside from here\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Ethereum noticeably has underperformed bitcoin in 2024. This is widely known. Specifically, at the time of this writing, ETH is up 18% for the year and BTC is up 70%. With bitcoin approaching a major breakout attempt and new all-time highs, it continues to attract all of the attention and rightly so. While it may seem like ether has been out of favor for a considerable length of time, it's not anything different than we've seen before over the years. In fact, this is the third time that the relative ETH/BTC line has been in a downtrend since 2016. Indeed, the current decline is the longest among the three, but it's clearly not the worst. From 2017-2019, ETH endured a lot more pain vs. BTC than it has since 2021. Overall, there have been five relative phases – with the other two being the times when ETH outperformed BTC. The question now is whether ETH is close to retaking the leadership position vs. BTC once again. With the relative line making multi-year lows, there's nothing to suggest that's about to happen, but trends have the tendency to flip suddenly and then all at once. If ETH is going to gain any traction on Bitcoin soon, it will need to take advantage of the potential bullish chart pattern it has just formed - this inverse head & shoulders formation. It has taken shape over the last few months, and ETH is getting closer to triggering it now. As is clear on the chart, ETH must get through the 2,700-zone for that to happen. The pattern's neckline is there, as well as the downtrend line that is measured from the May high. Ethereum both broke out and broke down from this same area in February and August, respectively. Even though ETH remains well off its highs, leveraging this pattern could help spur positive momentum once again. A breakout would target the $3,350-area, which is about 23% above current levels. And that could be just the start… The much bigger pattern is this potential cup and handle formation on the weekly chart in log scale, which spans three years. It will take some time (and a lot more upside) for this to become a reality, with ETH needing to ultimately overtake the March'24 highs near $4,100. But we've seen it before. Noted are the two biggest monthly pattern breakouts, which took place in 2017 and 2020. Needless to say, ETH extended much higher both times. Every time is different, but we've now seen bitcoin and ETH leverage technical patterns for nearly a decade now. Just because they've taken longer to play out this time doesn't mean they can't ultimately continue to work. -Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (Owns ETHE ETF.)

      "Title: What the charts are saying about the S&P 500 and Nvidia heading into the election\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: There is uncertainty abound about the future direction of the stock market heading into what many say is the most important presidential election of our lifetimes. A few days after the election our focus will probably quickly shift to the next Federal Reserve meeting on Nov. 7 and we'll realize it was just another election — and our place as the leading innovative country remains. With all of this uncertainty in the meantime however, this creates opportunity. Where is the opportunity? In the elevated volatility levels that began in late September heading into the election. Who is the opportunity for? For investors who may have been left behind in an under-exposed portfolio position waiting for a pullback. The S & P 500 made a new all-time high on September 18th (show in red). The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX in black) trades with an inverse relationship to the S & P 500. As the S & P 500 goes lower, people become fearful as they buy put option protection pushing the general level of option prices (both puts and calls) higher. This creates the inverse relationship of VIX and S & P 500. The same inverse relationship does not work on the upside as fear is a much stronger emotion than greed. The stock market does not crash higher, right? So when the market is breaking out to new highs the demand for call options also increases pushing prices of options higher, but not to the same degree as a downside move. As you can see the VIX is hanging around the 19-23 zone, which is elevated when you compare it to a stock market at all-time highs. When volatility levels are higher, investor anxiety is high, which means option premiums are high because people are buying protection. We can use this to our advantage if we want to accumulate stock positions. FOMO stocks If I had to guess, the stock that investors have the biggest FOMO (fear of missing out) is Nvidia (NVDA) . NVDA is in a strong uptrend and is showing mid-range volatility levels of its own. Earnings on NVDA are Nov 20, well after the election and the next Fed event so volatility levels are likely to remain elevated heading into earnings. All the other 'Magnificent 7' names will have reported earnings before the election, which brings in a market dynamic called \"IV crush\" or implied volatility crush. Apple, META, Google, etc will all see IV drops the day following their earnings release, regardless of the outcome, and will work against the purposes of this trade. NVDA has a mid-range volatility and uptrend support just below us. Should there be any kind of market pullback following the election, you can use this opportunity to accumulate a position in NVDA. Turning to the daily chart you'll see an intersection of blue dashed trendlines carving a zone of support around the $123 zone. Looking at the NVDA options that expire on Nov 22nd, just after earnings, they have the highest implied volatility. The $123 strike puts are trading for $2.40, which means if you sold those cash-secured puts, NVDA drops below that level and you were 'put the stock', your effective entry cost on NVDA is $123-$2.40 = $120.60. This is a way to take advantage of high volatility levels in the broader markets pre-election, as well as elevated volatility in NVDA heading into earnings. Once we get through the election and the Fed meeting we'll realize the sky was not falling and we're still the leading innovative and market value-creating country in the world. Our markets can then go back to their previously scheduled AI-fueled innovation boom with your newly accumulated position in NVDA that you bought as a discount making a new high. -Todd Gordon, Founder of Inside Edge Capital, LLC DISCLOSURES: (Gordon owns NVDA personally and in his wealth management company Inside Edge Capital.

      "Title: Beware McDonald's, but these other restaurant stocks look attractive, says Katie Stockton\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The sell-off for McDonald's Corp. (MCD) driven by the E. coli outbreak was meaningful from a chart perspective. The drop resulted in confirmation of intermediate-term overbought 'sell' signals from both the weekly stochastics and the DeMark Indicators. Additionally, MCD is overbought from a long-term perspective in our work. As a result, the MCD chart has the look of false breakout, which tends to give way to more downside. The downturns in the stochastics increase downside risk in the weeks ahead. Initial support on the chart is near $289 and then $272 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. McDonald's releases its earnings report tomorrow, which could contribute to near-term volatility. Should MCD get back into last week's gap, above roughly $302, that could help provide temporarily relief from the pullback. However, the intermediate-term 'sell' signals previously highlighted suggest an earnings-driven rally will likely fade quickly, so we might use strength to reduce exposure. Even with its recent decline, MCD ranks in the top half of stocks in the restaurant industry group when looking at 3-month and 6-month returns. However, the recent news of the outbreak and negative technical catalysts for MCD suggest investors should look elsewhere, for now. We expect rotation into some of the beleaguered laggards in the industry group. Laggards that could benefit Two examples of lagging restaurant stocks are Bloomin' Brands Inc. (BLMN) and Jack in the Box (JACK) , both of which have intermediate-term oversold 'buy' signals, which run counter to the 'sell' signals in MCD. The signals support counter-trend bounces lasting into year-end, which sets them up to outperform other restaurant stocks, many of which are overbought, over that timeframe. Next major resistance for JACK is at the 200-day, or 40-week moving average, near $58. Long-term support is near $40-$41 area, which goes all the way back to the 2007 peak. BLMN similarly has key support nearby from the 2022 low, near $15.90. Resistance levels to watch for BLMN are near $18.70 and then $20.90, both of which are Fibonacci retracement levels. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .

A well-defined series of lower highs and lower lows, as the stock works into the apex of the formation. And, now, boom, the stock is moving up and out of the formation, to the upside. A bullish resolution of the chart pattern, a bullish resolution after a period of equilibrium where bulls and bears have been matched off evenly and the stock has traded in a narrow and narrow, tighter and tighter range. As to where we believe VKTX is head... our price objective is the former high, at the $100+/- level. -Carter Braxton Worth For actionable recommendations via email and live nightly videos become a member at worthcharting.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

      "Text: While investors have been infatuated with the latest AI-fueled growth story, I'm actually finding more and more opportunities in defensive areas of the market. These are stocks that have generally underperformed for much of 2024, but recent price and momentum improvements are creating powerful setups with upside potential. Shares of Kroger Co. (KR) are threatening a new 52-week high this week, and a breakout above current levels would confirm one of the most bullish price patterns in the technical toolkit: the cup-with-handle pattern. We can see the cup-with-handle pattern developing on the daily chart, consisting of a six-month rounded bottoming pattern followed by a brief pullback in the month of October. The key to a cup with handle pattern is the \"rim\" of the cup, which is essentially a trendline connecting the highs during the price pattern. It's important to note that the cup-with-handle pattern is only validated once the price breaks above this resistance line, as that suggests a new influx of buying power with the potential to push prices even further. That means we would need to see a valid break above $57.50 to complete the bullish signal. Other indicators on the chart seem to suggest that an impending breakout is likely, especially the RSI which has been in a bullish range since July of this year. I've also drawn a trendline connecting the major lows since late 2023. As long as KR remains above this key trendline support, I'm inclined to consider this chart to represent a solid bullish trend. Now looking at a weekly chart of Kroger, we can see that the recent price action is actually part of a much larger cup-with-handle pattern that spans back to early 2022. While this is a much longer time frame than normally used for a cup-with-handle pattern, I would say at the very least that the weekly chart shows clear resistance in the $57-59 range. Similar to the daily chart, we can see the weekly RSI has been in a bullish range for the last five years. During a healthy bull market phase, the RSI will often become overbought on rallies and remain above the 40 level on price pullbacks. This continued bullish momentum range suggests a bullish secular trend, reinforcing the upside potential represented on the daily chart. There is a fractal nature to technical analysis, where price patterns and signals can often be corroborated by reviewing charts on multiple time frames. The daily and weekly charts for Kroger suggest an impending breakout that could be just the beginning of the next bull phase for this grocery giant. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

      "Title: Looking for hints in the stock charts ahead of earnings results from Meta and Alphabet\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: While technical analysis has many benefits, charts can't help one predict a company's financials. Thus, we never recommend chart-based trades for stocks that are within a week or two of reporting earnings. However, that does not mean we should ignore the technicals. In fact, the period just before and just after a stock reports is a perfect time to review the relevant patterns and levels. We're going to do just that today for Netflix (NFLX) , Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) , the biggest components of the S & P 500's communication services sector. While the biggest bank stocks historically kick off earnings season, traders have an eye on the first large cap growth stock to release numbers. And that's always Netflix . NFLX's report, and, more importantly, the reaction to said report, often sets the tone for what's in store for mega cap growth names, many of which release numbers later in the earnings season. NFLX had a strong report last Thursday, the market rewarded it with a huge 11% gain the following day. The stock gapped higher (at $736) and continued to advance before closing all the way up at $764. For holders of NFLX, that's great. For those wanting to buy it, but not wanting to chase it, it's an extremely challenging scenario. One strategy that's worked well for NFLX over the last year is paying attention to how the stock behaves vis-à-vis its earnings-induced gaps. It's had noticeable gaps post earnings in three of the last four quarters before this one – Two up and one down . NFLX respected the upside gaps from last October and January, with the stock trending higher over the ensuing three months. Conversely, it filled April's downside gap within a few weeks and rallied through mid-July. Thus, the next two weeks of action will prove important once again, with NFLX trying to hold above and, potentially, extend from last week's gap. Alphabet bullish pattern Alphabet reports earnings next week on Tuesday. The stock's technical set-up is crystal clear: it's been forming a potential bullish inverse head & shoulders pattern since coming back from the late-August to early-September sell-off. The back-and-forth price action the last three weeks has constructed the pattern's would-be right shoulder. The same gap-strategy applies to GOOGL post-earnings, but it's just as important to see if the bullish formation's structure is still viable. In other words, on a negative reaction, the best-case scenario would be having the stock respect the most recent low near $159. The stock's 200-day moving average is right there, too (not pictured). Also notice how the 14-day RSI is trying to hold near the 50 mid-point level. Staying in the range's upper half was a key during the stock's uptrend from March through July earlier this year. Meta's key area Lastly, but certainly not least, Meta reports next Wednesday. Meta has been a leading stock lately and broke out to new highs over a month ago. Like NFLX and GOOGL, it's done a good job extending from upside gaps and filling downside gaps in 2024 in between earnings reports. As is quite clear, it now will be important for Meta to hold above its last breakout zone (near $540) on any negative reaction after it releases numbers in a week. -Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (Owns GOOGL) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

      "Text: Spotify (SPOT) has been unofficially crowned the winner of the streaming music wars, besting much bigger brother mega-caps Apple Music and Amazon, as well as Sirius XM, and others. The stock is consolidating just below all-time highs and if Netflix's move after earnings is any indication, I think SPOT should punch through to new all-time highs. I hold SPOT in the Tactical Alpha Growth (TAG) portfolio as well as the Active Opportunities portfolio. If we see strong third-quarter earnings on November 12, I will look to increase my holdings. I first wrote about SPOT in July as the stock was trading at $343. We're currently trading at $386, just below the all-time highs of $387 set back in 2021. Looking at the weekly chart of SPOT on the approach of all-time highs looking at the trend channel (blue dashed lines) you'll see the price is at the middle line of the channel, which I classify as neutral. Not oversold at the lower end of the channel or overbought at the upper end of the channel, but right in the middle ahead of a possible 'upstream' move to new highs. Turning to the daily chart we see a nice bull-flag pattern forming below the key $387 highs. All we're waiting on is another rush of accumulation volume like we saw in April '24 and Sept '24 to punch us through to new all time highs. The earnings trajectory for this company has been insane: 2022 EPS ($3.09) 2023 EPS ($2.95) 2024 EPS +$6.37 2025 EPS +$9.06 (est.) The company went from losing almost 3 dollars a share in 2023 to making $6.37. The expectations for 2025 is another 40%-plus growth on the bottom line as the company continues to generate more free cash flow. Netflix could be a nice indication of what's to come for SPOT as it's in the same communications sector, the same entertainment industry, and the same movies & entertainment sub-industry group. Netflix beat expectations and broke to new all-time highs led by new subs, 50% of which are coming from an ad tier. SPOT is testing new add tiers and markets are likely to discount in additional cash flow as SPOT rolls out new membership levels. Spotify is also heavily embracing AI to optimize content recommendation to users much like Meta has for Instagram and Facebook, and we know what's happening with that stock. Meta is also in the communication sector sitting close to new all-time highs like NFLX, so the trend for this group remains firmly higher. -Todd Gordon, Founder of Inside Edge Capital , LLC DISCLOSURES: (Gordon owns SPOT personally and in his wealth management company Inside Edge Capital.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The precious metals complex has seen strong performance this year, with gold returning 32% year-to-date and silver returning nearly 40%. Long-term bullish trends are intact for each commodity, but silver looks more actionable in the near term from a technical perspective. While silver has produced strong returns this year, it does not appear overextended when looking at the monthly chart of the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) , which shows a secular turnaround. Long-term momentum is positive and expanding per the monthly MACD and histogram as silver pushes to its highest level since 2013. Next resistance for SLV is not until a long-term Fibonacci level near $34.00, which is a 61.8% retracement of the downtrend from 2011 to 2020. Zooming in on the weekly chart, SLV has broken out from a six-month trading range on positive intermediate-term momentum, which supports a bullish bias over the next few months. In the short term, there are some signs of exhaustion that support a retest of the breakout point near $29.60, which would provide a more favorable entry point. Additional support for SLV is at the 50-day (10-week) moving average near $27.60. Silver's breakout in absolute terms has the potential to result in relative outperformance versus gold in the weeks ahead. The gold/silver ratio has seen intermediate-term momentum shift lower per the 10-week MA, and has room to support at the bottom of a long-term trading range. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: With a resurgence of travel demand driving strong earnings and analyst upgrades, the cruise line industry appears to be entering a new bullish regime. While charts like Carnival Corp. (CCL) have once again become overbought, the strength of the recent breakout suggests they may just be getting started. Starting with the weekly chart, we can see that over the last 18 months, Carnival had found consistent resistance around $19.50. Through the course of 2024, numerous tests of this price resistance led to a pullback down to around $14, as the stock settled into a fairly consistent price range. The longer a resistance level is tested, the more meaningful it becomes when the price finally breaks above this price ceiling. Or as legendary technical analyst Alan Shaw used to say, \"The broader the base, the higher in space.\" Given the strength of the breakout, combined with the fact that momentum indicators do not signal an overextended situation, we could see a retest of the 2021 high in the low 30's. On the daily chart, we can see the broad base in much more detail, as well as the significance of the breakout above the $19.50 level earlier this month. Given that broken resistance levels often become support, we would expect $19.50 to be a decent \"line in the sand\" to watch on pullbacks. As long as CCL remains above this breakout level, the uptrend phase appears to be in good shape. Note the daily RSI which has pushed above the crucial 70 level on the recent breakout. This usually indicates two things: the overall trend is positive, as stocks usually only become overbought during bull phases; and we may be due for a brief pullback, similar to what we observed in mid-September. One way to guard against a painful pullback in this situation is to use a trailing stop indicator like the Chandelier Exit system. Popularized by Alexander Elder, this indicator is based on average true range (ATR) and provides a dynamic stop based on the volatility of the price action. Note how the pullbacks in early September and early October found support at the purple chandelier exit line on the way up from the August low? As long as the Chandelier Exit line holds, the indicator suggests that the uptrend is still strong. The recent breakout for cruise lines like Carnival Corp. suggests that the uptrend phase may just be beginning. By using a sound technical analysis approach, savvy investors can benefit from uptrends and also minimize downside risk once the uptrend is exhausted. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

      "Title: What the charts say about whether the S&P 500 can continue higher into year-end\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The S & P 500 continues to make new highs, and volatility continues to decline. That's typically a recipe for success. The question, of course, is whether the market's advance can continue with earnings season heating up over the next two weeks and with both the presidential election and the next Fed meeting both happening in the first week of November. If there's going to be a bump in the suddenly smooth road, logic suggests it's going to happen soon. Indeed, the market will do whatever it wants, which sometimes is the complete opposite of logical. With that in mind, here are a few things that have caught our attention recently that investors should be mindful of in the coming weeks: Low two-way volatility First, two-way volatility has plummeted. We can see this a few different ways. First, the S & P 500 has logged just two absolute 1% moves since Sept. 19, which is nearly a month's worth of trading. For some context, in August, there were TEN, which was the most in a calendar month since March'23. Low two-way volatility leads to bullish chart formations and clean breakouts. No long winning or losing streaks Secondly, the S & P 500 hasn't logged more than two straight gains since seven in a row from Sept. 9 to Sept. 17. That may sound discouraging, but the S & P 500 hasn't logged any consecutive declines since the four straight losses from Sept. 3 to Sept. 6. The absence of follow through on both sides shows a lack of conviction. Again, with so many micro and macro data points and events on the docket, we can understand why. A lot of new 52-week highs Despite the apparent back and forth movement, many indices and stocks have been edging higher the last few weeks. In fact, 114 S & P 500 stocks made new 52-week highs on Tuesday, which was the first time we've had over 100 since 7/16/24. Yes, the SPX last made a new high on that day, and the summer swoon soon took hold. Tuesday's total also was the second highest of the entire run since last October, only slightly behind the 118 from March 21. A quick glimpse of all the 100-new high days shows that while the S & P 500's long-term uptrend has persisted, buying right after a 100-new-high session has not yielded immediate upside. Bearish Engulfing Pattern Tuesday's high number of new 52-week highs was immediately followed by a negative reversal session, and the S & P 500 finished on its intra-day lows. With the day's opening and close both being higher and lower than the prior session's, this created a bearish engulfing pattern. This is the seventh bearish engulfing pattern since last December. All but one of them happened near a key trading high – the outlier was the August 2nd huge reversal. Four of the last six occurrences led to further near-term weakness (April, July and twice in August). In December and May, the bearish engulfing patterns didn't result in much selling, but the market did pause over the short term before the bid returned. Ultimately, the bid came back each time. But buying immediately after a bearish engulfing pattern has not been the best strategy, at least since last December. Waiting for the ensuing digestion phase to come and go has been a better course of action. Successful Bullish Chart Patterns While the market may be short-term extended now, it's important to know that bullish patterns continue to work - which is the first and last factor we always consider. Think about this: While the intense summer volatility was difficult to sit through, all of it was necessary for the next set of bullish formations to take shape. We follow these across various time frames at CappThesis, which provides a very good understanding of the market's state. Focusing on the weekly chart, it's clear that bullish patterns have been successful ever since the market bottomed in 2022. Thus, if the uptrend is going to continue, we'll need chart formations to continue to resolve higher. That's obvious, but it's exactly what did not happen in the 2022 bear market. The bottom line is that the S & P 500 and dozens of its holdings have built up substantial cushions by strongly coming back from the August lows. The hope is that this will help the market withstand the prospective volatility over the next few weeks.

      "Text: The AI trade is powering ahead as the markets are seeing a rotation back into the semiconductor, hardware and software companies that are driving the revolution. One industrial company on my radar — that I don't yet have a position in — is Vertiv (VRT) . The company provides liquid cooling systems for data centers powering AI. Liquid cooling is a technology that will continue to gain momentum with the large data centers operated by the 'hyperscalers' along with the co-location market, which involves renting server space to smaller companies. You can read a bigger explanation of how liquid cooling works and the other companies involved here . In the last three quarters, VRT reported quarter-over-quarter EPS growth of 46%, 79% and 100%, respectively. In those same quarters, the ESP beat consensus expectations by 17%, 20%, and 5%, respectively. Looking at the weekly chart you can easily see the massive run this company has seen form the 2022 lows. Technically speaking, I see additional upside possible (likely?) targeting the confluence of Fibonacci projection levels ranging from $127 to $171. I know it's a wide zone, but consider the percentage gain this stock has experienced in the past 2 years. I do not yet have a position in this stock and want to use any pullback from a test of the all-time highs to build a position in the growth portfolio at Inside Edge Capital. Turning to the daily chart we see the stock is pulling back from the all-time highs with an anticipated support zone of $103-$95. I plan to begin building a position buying approximately one-third of my intended position size on a pullback to $105, and then add another one-third into the $100 zone and then add as/if we break new highs. -Todd Gordon, Founder of Inside Edge Capital , LLC DISCLOSURES: (Gordon does not own VRT personally or in his wealth management company Inside Edge Capital at the time of publication, but that may change.

      "Title: Katie Stockton says it's too early to buy the dip in Boeing, stick with aerospace winners\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: Shares of aerospace giant Boeing (BA) have been hammered thus far in 2024, with a negative year-to-date return of 44%. The stock's underperformance versus its peers in the S & P 500 Aerospace and Defense Index is staggering, with most stocks in the group having had a strong year. With such a persistent down-move, investors are wondering when it might be time to step back in from the long side. A monthly chart of BA shows important long-term trendline support near current levels, near $147, with a big \"cloud\" of resistance denoted by the shaded area on the chart. The uptrend line would be a natural place for the stock to stabilize, noting the stochastic oscillator is deep in oversold territory. However, next week's earnings report has the potential to create volatility, so we would take a wait-and-see approach before considering a position. Should the trendline be broken, it would be another setback for BA, increasing downside risk to secondary support near $120. Should oversold conditions yield stabilization, we would look for an upturn in the monthly stochastics > 20% as a positive long-term catalyst. Zooming in on the weekly bar chart, BA shows downside momentum per the declining 10- and 40-week moving averages. The 10-week MA frames initial resistance on the chart, near $162. A downtrend is pronounced in the ratio of BA versus the S & P 500 Index (SPX), as well, noting BA is making 24-year relative lows. The persistent long-term trend of underperformance suggests that the company has major problems, but 60% of fundamental analysts who publish research on BA still have \"buy\" ratings, with an average 12-month price target of about $197. This tells us to watch for reactions to oversold conditions in both absolute and relative terms. The underperformance from BA versus its peers is visually evident when charting it against the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) , which has cyclical and secular bull trends in place, making new all-time highs today. Relative to the S & P 500, ITA is in a bullish turnaround phase, which sets the group up well for outperformance in the months ahead. While BA has support in-line on its chart, we would wait for downside momentum to alleviate before considering a counter-trend position. For now, we would stay with the winners in the sector that remain in uptrends, such as GE Aerospace , Lockheed Martin , and RTX Corp . Once BA shows support discovery, ideally accompanied by an upturn in the monthly stochastics, we could have more confidence that a major low is in place. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: While news of a potential break-up has investors reasonably cautious on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) , this week's pullback could be setting up one of the more bullish patterns in the technical analysis toolkit. Let's dig into what this pattern represents, and what key price level investors should be watching for in the days to come. The inverted-head-and-shoulders bottom is formed when you have a major low surrounded by two higher lows. In the case of GOOGL, that means we're focusing on the September low around $148, as well as the higher swing low in early August around $155. This week's sell-off could result in the formation of the right shoulder, completing the set-up of this bullish price pattern. An ideal inverted-head-and-shoulders pattern features a fairly symmetrical pattern where the left and right sides are comparable in time and price range. So a right shoulder in the $155-$160 range would line up well with the price action over the last quarter. The good news is GOOGL is testing its 200-day moving average this week, currently sitting around $159.50. Further price support could emerge at the 61.8% retracement level using the March to September rally as a framework for the analysis. So Alphabet is definitely in the price range where meaningful support could be expected. The most important level for this price pattern is the \"neckline\" formed by the swing highs between the head and the two shoulders. In this case, that would mean the price highs in mid-August and earlier this month. Note how this neckline lines up almost perfectly with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level using the framework described above. I tend to relate a chart like this to using an \"if-then\" statement in Excel or your favorite computer language. If GOOGL is able to break above the neckline at $168, then we would most likely see a retest of the July peak around $191. Other Magnificent 7 stocks Interestingly enough, Alphabet is not the only Magnificent 7 name testing its 200-day moving average this week. Fellow mega cap growth stocks Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are also testing this long-term trend barometer on the daily charts. If charts like AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL are able to hold their 200-day moving average, then October could turn out to be just a brief interruption of a larger bullish phase. But if leading names like these are unable to hold key moving average support, that would likely have a dramatically bearish impact on the major equity averages. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

      "\n",
      "Text: In the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, the technology sector stands poised for renewed momentum, echoing the performance seen during his 2016 presidency. A pro-business agenda, regulatory flexibility, and potential tax incentives under his administration could once again set the stage for technology stocks to outperform. Adobe (ADBE) , a leader in AI-enhanced creative solutions, is particularly well-positioned to capitalize on this environment. Following a record earnings report that underscores the demand for its Digital Media, Document Cloud, and AI-driven creative tools, Adobe's recent oversold conditions offer a rare opportunity for investors to add exposure at a reasonable valuation. With its superior growth rates and operational margins that set it apart from peers, Adobe's valuation presents a compelling entry point amid strong fundamentals and a supportive administration. Adobe recently reached oversold conditions on both daily and weekly timeframes and recently showed signs of positive divergence. This signals that sellers are starting to get exhausted and presents an opportunity for buyers to start stepping in for a strong counter-trend rally. The stock has been trading in a broad range but shows resilience near recent support levels, indicating a solid base from which it could move higher. This set-up offers an attractive risk/reward entry point for adding bullish exposure. Adobe's fundamentals are strong, with a 10% year-over-year increase in revenue to a record $4.89 billion. The company also achieved notable growth across its core segments: Digital Media, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud, which grew by 11%, 15%, and 11%, respectively. Adobe's operating margins remain impressive at 25.6%, significantly higher than the industry average of 16.8%, while the stock trades at only 23.5x forward earnings, compared to the industry average of 27.8 times. With growth rates and margins that exceed the industry, ADBE's 15% discount reflects a substantial upside opportunity from a valuation perspective. To capitalize on a potential rally in Adobe, consider buying the December 20, 2024, $500/550 Call Vertical @ $18.05 Debit. This position entails: Buying 1 Dec 20, 2024, $500 Call @ $27.40 Selling 1 Dec 20, 2024, $550 Call @ $9.35 This call spread strategy allows for significant upside potential with limited risk. The maximum potential reward is $3,195, achieved if ADBE closes above $550 at expiration, while the maximum risk is capped at $1,805 if ADBE remains below $500 at expiration. Given Adobe's technical and fundamental strengths, this strategy aligns with the bullish thesis and benefits from a potential rally in ADBE shares driven by AI advancements and continued revenue growth.

      "Text: U.S. stocks soared to record highs after Donald Trump's election win and a quarter-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve. U.S. government bond yields have surged too, puzzling many market participants. I am going to stick with the contrarian view and bet on rates continuing to move higher. I'll express that through a bearish bet on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) which tracks bond prices. (If rates rise, the ETF's value will decrease since bond prices and yields move inversely to each other.) TLT 3M mountain iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), 3 months Prior to the September half-point rate cut, market expectations were for the benchmark 10-year note's yield to go down, not up. Various inputs have driven yields higher, creating the opposite outcome for the Fed as they continue to try to land the proverbial plane. US10Y 3M mountain U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, 3 months The government's 2024 budget deficit (nearly $2 trillion) and the annual cost of government debt service vaulted over $1 trillion (for the first time ever) in order to finance the cost on our gigantic U.S. debt of $36 trillion. The looming and growing fiscal situation has been a catalyst for bond investors to push yields higher as they demand more reward (higher yielding bonds) knowing the massive amount of government issued supply headed down the pipeline. The 10-year note is up roughly 60 basis points on this notion since September's initial significant rate cut. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.) Jeffrey Gundlach stated (post Fed meeting) that interest rates could shoot even higher if Republicans end up controlling the House too. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has attributed the recent rise in yields to stronger growth and not a potential reacceleration in inflation, nor the fact that debt service on our massive debt has gone up over 300%. The trade Long and short here, bond vigilantes are looking to push the 10-year yield up and above 5%, that should make TLT move lower. I want to define my risk in this trade and own a put spread to capture this potential downside move in the long end of the Treasury curve. The TLT portfolio's effective duration is 16.5 years creating additional sensitivity to the long end. Bought the 1/17/2025 TLT $92 put for $2.60 Sold the 1/17/2025 TLT $88 put for $1.10 Costing an investor $1.50 or $150 per spread This spread was executed when TLT was roughly trading $92.

      "Text: Considering sectors or industries likely to benefit from a new Trump administration, some have remained moribund for several years and remain well below their all-time highs even after rallying sharply Wednesday. That leaves a trading opportunity to capitalize on using options. For example, there are several such stocks in the energy sector — a topic of debate in the swing state of Pennsylvania where some of Kamala Harris's prior statements about a Federal ban on fracking may have had some voters wondering whether a critical industry in their state might suffer. Traditionally Republicans have been more significant friends of the oil and gas industry. Increasing domestic oil production would theoretically achieve several goals for the new administration: increase domestic economic activity and employment, increase domestic energy security, and lower oil and gas prices. Interestingly, oil and gas production in the United States right now, the world's largest producer, has never been higher, and oil and gas prices, while well above pre-COVID levels, have stabilized. Increasing production, if that's possible, might not benefit all energy sector participants equally. The incoming Trump administration will likely reduce federal regulations on drilling, pipeline development, and environmental protections that limit the expansion of oil and gas projects. This deregulation could reduce costs for companies in oilfield services and speed up project approvals. The Biden administration has enforced stricter regulations focusing on reducing fossil fuel reliance. Biden has limited new drilling on federal lands and promoted more stringent standards, although these were loosened/accelerated a bit more recently. During his first term, Trump expanded drilling rights on federal lands and offshore areas, which some suggest may have more capacity for expansion than on-shore production, which opened up more opportunities for oil services to support exploration and drilling. His administration also relaxed restrictions on Arctic drilling despite limited interest in those leases. Trump supported pipeline projects like Keystone XL and Dakota Access. This infrastructure investment benefits the oil services industry by enabling more accessible transport and new development projects, which Biden canceled. The trade The incoming administration will likely reduce regulatory pressures, promote expansion in the North American oil services industry, and expedite permitting on drilling and infrastructure projects. These actions will be particularly beneficial for the industry, which has been essentially dead money since early 2020. One way to play this trade through the inauguration is with a \"poor man's covered call,\" what we generally refer to as a diagonal call spread — purchasing a longer-dated call and offsetting the decay by selling nearer-dated calls against it.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Text: The financial sector broke out of its trading range recently and has been soaring after a stellar round of earnings reports from major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley. However, markets don't usually move in a straight line. A recent mean reversion trade I shared on Alibaba demonstrated this well when I pointed out that Chinese stocks were due for a pullback. Today, I'm looking at a potential mean reversion trade on JPMorgan (JPM) . In the 9-month daily chart of JPM, I've highlighted a sharp decline in the RSI (Relative Strength Index), which signals a loss of upward momentum. Additionally, we're seeing a potential DMI (Directional Movement Index) crossover, with the DI+ (green line) on the verge of crossing below the DI- (red line). I've marked several previous instances of this crossover in the chart, each indicating a trend shift. DMI crossovers like this often provide reliable signals of impending trend changes. I cover many of these setups in my book Mean Reversion Trading . The trade Given the bearish sentiment developing on JPM, I'm opting for a strategy known as a \"bear put spread\" to potentially capitalize on a pullback. This strategy entails buying a higher strike put and selling a lower strike put, creating a net debit position. For instance, with JPM trading around $220, I'd set up the trade by purchasing a 225 strike put and simultaneously selling a 220 strike put. Here's the trade setup: Buy 225 strike put (Nov 22 expiry) Sell 220 strike put (Nov 22 expiry) Cost: $250 (limit price 2.50c) If JPM trades at or below $220 on the expiration date, this trade could yield a 100% return on the initial risk. For instance, with 10 contracts, one could risk $2500 to potentially profit $2500. Risks to this trade: This week brings a lot of uncertainty with the upcoming elections, which could inject volatility into the markets. Additionally, the FOMC rate decision is scheduled for Thursday, and as a major market-moving event, it could cause rapid shifts in direction. -Nishant Pant Founder: https://tradingextremes.com Author: Mean Reversion Trading Youtube, Twitter: @TheMeanTrader DISCLOSURES: (Nishant currently holds a JPM 225-220 put spread expiring on 11/22.)
